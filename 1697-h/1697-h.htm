<h1>MADAM HOW AND LADY WHY<br />
or, FIRST LESSONS IN EARTH LORE FOR CHILDREN</h1>
<h2>DEDICATION</h2>
<p>To my son Grenville Arthur, and to his school-fellows at Winton House<br />
This little book is dedicated.</p>
<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>My dear boys,&mdash;When I was your age, there were no such children&rsquo;s
books as there are now.&nbsp; Those which we had were few and dull,
and the pictures in them ugly and mean: while you have your choice of
books without number, clear, amusing, and pretty, as well as really
instructive, on subjects which were only talked of fifty years ago by
a few learned men, and very little understood even by them.&nbsp; So
if mere reading of books would make wise men, you ought to grow up much
wiser than us old fellows.&nbsp; But mere reading of wise books will
not make you wise men: you must use for yourselves the tools with which
books are made wise; and that is&mdash;your eyes, and ears, and common
sense.</p>
<p>Now, among those very stupid old-fashioned boys&rsquo; books was
one which taught me that; and therefore I am more grateful to it than
if it had been as full of wonderful pictures as all the natural history
books you ever saw.&nbsp; Its name was <i>Evenings at Home</i>; and
in it was a story called &ldquo;Eyes and no Eyes;&rdquo; a regular old-fashioned,
prim, sententious story; and it began thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Robert, where have you been walking this afternoon?&rdquo;
said Mr. Andrews to one of his pupils at the close of a holiday.</p>
<p>Oh&mdash;Robert had been to Broom Heath, and round by Camp Mount,
and home through the meadows.&nbsp; But it was very dull.&nbsp; He hardly
saw a single person.&nbsp; He had much rather have gone by the turnpike-road.</p>
<p>Presently in comes Master William, the other pupil, dressed, I suppose,
as wretched boys used to be dressed forty years ago, in a frill collar,
and skeleton monkey-jacket, and tight trousers buttoned over it, and
hardly coming down to his ancles; and low shoes, which always came off
in sticky ground; and terribly dirty and wet he is: but he never (he
says) had such a pleasant walk in his life; and he has brought home
his handkerchief (for boys had no pockets in those days much bigger
than key-holes) full of curiosities.</p>
<p>He has got a piece of mistletoe, wants to know what it is; and he
has seen a woodpecker, and a wheat-ear, and gathered strange flowers
on the heath; and hunted a peewit because he thought its wing was broken,
till of course it led him into a bog, and very wet he got.&nbsp; But
he did not mind it, because he fell in with an old man cutting turf,
who told him all about turf-cutting, and gave him a dead adder.&nbsp;
And then he went up a hill, and saw a grand prospect; and wanted to
go again, and make out the geography of the country from Cary&rsquo;s
old county maps, which were the only maps in those days.&nbsp; And then,
because the hill was called Camp Mount, he looked for a Roman camp,
and found one; and then he went down to the river, saw twenty things
more; and so on, and so on, till he had brought home curiosities enough,
and thoughts enough, to last him a week.</p>
<p>Whereon Mr. Andrews, who seems to have been a very sensible old gentleman,
tells him all about his curiosities: and then it comes out&mdash;if
you will believe it&mdash;that Master William has been over the very
same ground as Master Robert, who saw nothing at all.</p>
<p>Whereon Mr. Andrews says, wisely enough, in his solemn old-fashioned
way,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is.&nbsp; One man walks through the world with his eyes
open, another with his eyes shut; and upon this difference depends all
the superiority of knowledge which one man acquires over another.&nbsp;
I have known sailors who had been in all the quarters of the world,
and could tell you nothing but the signs of the tippling-houses, and
the price and quality of the liquor.&nbsp; On the other hand, Franklin
could not cross the Channel without making observations useful to mankind.&nbsp;
While many a vacant thoughtless youth is whirled through Europe without
gaining a single idea worth crossing the street for, the observing eye
and inquiring mind find matter of improvement and delight in every ramble.&nbsp;
You, then, William, continue to use your eyes.&nbsp; And you, Robert,
learn that eyes were given to you to use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So said Mr. Andrews: and so I say, dear boys&mdash;and so says he
who has the charge of you&mdash;to you.&nbsp; Therefore I beg all good
boys among you to think over this story, and settle in their own minds
whether they will be eyes or no eyes; whether they will, as they grow
up, look and see for themselves what happens: or whether they will let
other people look for them, or pretend to look; and dupe them, and lead
them about&mdash;the blind leading the blind, till both fall into the
ditch.</p>
<p>I say &ldquo;good boys;&rdquo; not merely clever boys, or prudent
boys: because using your eyes, or not using them, is a question of doing
Right or doing Wrong.&nbsp; God has given you eyes; it is your duty
to God to use them.&nbsp; If your parents tried to teach you your lessons
in the most agreeable way, by beautiful picture-books, would it not
be ungracious, ungrateful, and altogether naughty and wrong, to shut
your eyes to those pictures, and refuse to learn?&nbsp; And is it not
altogether naughty and wrong to refuse to learn from your Father in
Heaven, the Great God who made all things, when he offers to teach you
all day long by the most beautiful and most wonderful of all picture-books,
which is simply all things which you can see, hear, and touch, from
the sun and stars above your head to the mosses and insects at your
feet?&nbsp; It is your duty to learn His lessons: and it is your interest.&nbsp;
God&rsquo;s Book, which is the Universe, and the reading of God&rsquo;s
Book, which is Science, can do you nothing but good, and teach you nothing
but truth and wisdom.&nbsp; God did not put this wondrous world about
your young souls to tempt or to mislead them.&nbsp; If you ask Him for
a fish, he will not give you a serpent.&nbsp; If you ask Him for bread,
He will not give you a stone.</p>
<p>So use your eyes and your intellect, your senses and your brains,
and learn what God is trying to teach you continually by them.&nbsp;
I do not mean that you must stop there, and learn nothing more.&nbsp;
Anything but that.&nbsp; There are things which neither your senses
nor your brains can tell you; and they are not only more glorious, but
actually more true and more real than any things which you can see or
touch.&nbsp; But you must begin at the beginning in order to end at
the end, and sow the seed if you wish to gather the fruit.&nbsp; God
has ordained that you, and every child which comes into the world, should
begin by learning something of the world about him by his senses and
his brain; and the better you learn what they can teach you, the more
fit you will be to learn what they cannot teach you.&nbsp; The more
you try now to understand <i>things</i>, the more you will be able hereafter
to understand men, and That which is above men.&nbsp; You began to find
out that truly Divine mystery, that you had a mother on earth, simply
by lying soft and warm upon her bosom; and so (as Our Lord told the
Jews of old) it is by watching the common natural things around you,
and considering the lilies of the field, how they grow, that you will
begin at least to learn that far Diviner mystery, that you have a Father
in Heaven.&nbsp; And so you will be delivered (if you will) out of the
tyranny of darkness, and distrust, and fear, into God&rsquo;s free kingdom
of light, and faith, and love; and will be safe from the venom of that
tree which is more deadly than the fabled upas of the East.&nbsp; Who
planted that tree I know not, it was planted so long ago: but surely
it is none of God&rsquo;s planting, neither of the Son of God: yet it
grows in all lands and in all climes, and sends its hidden suckers far
and wide, even (unless we be watchful) into your hearts and mine.&nbsp;
And its name is the Tree of Unreason, whose roots are conceit and ignorance,
and its juices folly and death.&nbsp; It drops its venom into the finest
brains; and makes them call sense, nonsense; and nonsense, sense; fact,
fiction; and fiction, fact.&nbsp; It drops its venom into the tenderest
hearts, alas! and makes them call wrong, right; and right, wrong; love,
cruelty; and cruelty, love.&nbsp; Some say that the axe is laid to the
root of it just now, and that it is already tottering to its fall: while
others say that it is growing stronger than ever, and ready to spread
its upas-shade over the whole earth.&nbsp; For my part, I know not,
save that all shall be as God wills.&nbsp; The tree has been cut down
already again and again; and yet has always thrown out fresh shoots
and dropped fresh poison from its boughs.&nbsp; But this at least I
know: that any little child, who will use the faculties God has given
him, may find an antidote to all its poison in the meanest herb beneath
his feet.</p>
<p>There, you do not understand me, my boys; and the best prayer I can
offer for you is, perhaps, that you should never need to understand
me: but if that sore need should come, and that poison should begin
to spread its mist over your brains and hearts, then you will be proof
against it; just in proportion as you have used the eyes and the common
sense which God has given you, and have considered the lilies of the
field, how they grow.</p>
<p>C. KINGSLEY.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER I&mdash;THE GLEN</h2>
<p>You find it dull walking up here upon Hartford Bridge Flat this sad
November day?&nbsp; Well, I do not deny that the moor looks somewhat
dreary, though dull it need never be.&nbsp; Though the fog is clinging
to the fir-trees, and creeping among the heather, till you cannot see
as far as Minley Corner, hardly as far as Bramshill woods&mdash;and
all the Berkshire hills are as invisible as if it was a dark midnight&mdash;yet
there is plenty to be seen here at our very feet.&nbsp; Though there
is nothing left for you to pick, and all the flowers are dead and brown,
except here and there a poor half-withered scrap of bottle-heath, and
nothing left for you to catch either, for the butterflies and insects
are all dead too, except one poor old Daddy-long-legs, who sits upon
that piece of turf, boring a hole with her tail to lay her eggs in,
before the frost catches her and ends her like the rest: though all
things, I say, seem dead, yet there is plenty of life around you, at
your feet, I may almost say in the very stones on which you tread.&nbsp;
And though the place itself be dreary enough, a sheet of flat heather
and a little glen in it, with banks of dead fern, and a brown bog between
them, and a few fir-trees struggling up&mdash;yet, if you only have
eyes to see it, that little bit of glen is beautiful and wonderful,&mdash;so
beautiful and so wonderful and so cunningly devised, that it took thousands
of years to make it; and it is not, I believe, half finished yet.</p>
<p>How do I know all that?&nbsp; Because a fairy told it me; a fairy
who lives up here upon the moor, and indeed in most places else, if
people have but eyes to see her.&nbsp; What is her name?&nbsp; I cannot
tell.&nbsp; The best name that I can give her (and I think it must be
something like her real name, because she will always answer if you
call her by it patiently and reverently) is Madam How.&nbsp; She will
come in good time, if she is called, even by a little child.&nbsp; And
she will let us see her at her work, and, what is more, teach us to
copy her.&nbsp; But there is another fairy here likewise, whom we can
hardly hope to see.&nbsp; Very thankful should we be if she lifted even
the smallest corner of her veil, and showed us but for a moment if it
were but her finger tip&mdash;so beautiful is she, and yet so awful
too.&nbsp; But that sight, I believe, would not make us proud, as if
we had had some great privilege.&nbsp; No, my dear child: it would make
us feel smaller, and meaner, and more stupid and more ignorant than
we had ever felt in our lives before; at the same time it would make
us wiser than ever we were in our lives before&mdash;that one glimpse
of the great glory of her whom we call Lady Why.</p>
<p>But I will say more of her presently.&nbsp; We must talk first with
Madam How, and perhaps she may help us hereafter to see Lady Why.&nbsp;
For she is the servant, and Lady Why is the mistress; though she has
a Master over her again&mdash;whose name I leave for you to guess.&nbsp;
You have heard it often already, and you will hear it again, for ever
and ever.</p>
<p>But of one thing I must warn you, that you must not confound Madam
How and Lady Why.&nbsp; Many people do it, and fall into great mistakes
thereby,&mdash;mistakes that even a little child, if it would think,
need not commit.&nbsp; But really great philosophers sometimes make
this mistake about Why and How; and therefore it is no wonder if other
people make it too, when they write children&rsquo;s books about the
wonders of nature, and call them &ldquo;Why and Because,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The
Reason Why.&rdquo;&nbsp; The books are very good books, and you should
read and study them: but they do not tell you really &ldquo;Why and
Because,&rdquo; but only &ldquo;How and So.&rdquo;&nbsp; They do not
tell you the &ldquo;Reason Why&rdquo; things happen, but only &ldquo;The
Way in which they happen.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, I must not blame these
good folks, for I have made the same mistake myself often, and may do
it again: but all the more shame to me.&nbsp; For see&mdash;you know
perfectly the difference between How and Why, when you are talking about
yourself.&nbsp; If I ask you, &ldquo;Why did we go out to-day?&rdquo;&nbsp;
You would not answer, &ldquo;Because we opened the door.&rdquo;&nbsp;
That is the answer to &ldquo;How did we go out?&rdquo;&nbsp; The answer
to Why did we go out is, &ldquo;Because we chose to take a walk.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Now when we talk about other things beside ourselves, we must remember
this same difference between How and Why.&nbsp; If I ask you, &ldquo;Why
does fire burn you?&rdquo; you would answer, I suppose, being a little
boy, &ldquo;Because it is hot;&rdquo; which is all you know about it.&nbsp;
But if you were a great chemist, instead of a little boy, you would
be apt to answer me, I am afraid, &ldquo;Fire burns because the vibratory
motion of the molecules of the heated substance communicates itself
to the molecules of my skin, and so destroys their tissue;&rdquo; which
is, I dare say, quite true: but it only tells us how fire burns, the
way or means by which it burns; it does not tell us the reason why it
burns.</p>
<p>But you will ask, &ldquo;If that is not the reason why fire burns,
what is?&rdquo;&nbsp; My dear child, I do not know.&nbsp; That is Lady
Why&rsquo;s business, who is mistress of Mrs. How, and of you and of
me; and, as I think, of all things that you ever saw, or can see, or
even dream.&nbsp; And what her reason for making fire burn may be I
cannot tell.&nbsp; But I believe on excellent grounds that her reason
is a very good one.&nbsp; If I dare to guess, I should say that one
reason, at least, why fire burns, is that you may take care not to play
with it, and so not only scorch your finger, but set your whole bed
on fire, and perhaps the house into the bargain, as you might be tempted
to do if putting your finger in the fire were as pleasant as putting
sugar in your mouth.</p>
<p>My dear child, if I could once get clearly into your head this difference
between Why and How, so that you should remember them steadily in after
life, I should have done you more good than if I had given you a thousand
pounds.</p>
<p>But now that we know that How and Why are two very different matters,
and must not be confounded with each other, let us look for Madam How,
and see her at work making this little glen; for, as I told you, it
is not half made yet.&nbsp; One thing we shall see at once, and see
it more and more clearly the older we grow; I mean her wonderful patience
and diligence.&nbsp; Madam How is never idle for an instant.&nbsp; Nothing
is too great or too small for her; and she keeps her work before her
eye in the same moment, and makes every separate bit of it help every
other bit.&nbsp; She will keep the sun and stars in order, while she
looks after poor old Mrs. Daddy-long-legs there and her eggs.&nbsp;
She will spend thousands of years in building up a mountain, and thousands
of years in grinding it down again; and then carefully polish every
grain of sand which falls from that mountain, and put it in its right
place, where it will be wanted thousands of years hence; and she will
take just as much trouble about that one grain of sand as she did about
the whole mountain.&nbsp; She will settle the exact place where Mrs.
Daddy-long-legs shall lay her eggs, at the very same time that she is
settling what shall happen hundreds of years hence in a stair millions
of miles away.&nbsp; And I really believe that Madam How knows her work
so thoroughly, that the grain of sand which sticks now to your shoe,
and the weight of Mrs. Daddy-long-legs&rsquo; eggs at the bottom of
her hole, will have an effect upon suns and stars ages after you and
I are dead and gone.&nbsp; Most patient indeed is Madam How.&nbsp; She
does not mind the least seeing her own work destroyed; she knows that
it must be destroyed.&nbsp; There is a spell upon her, and a fate, that
everything she makes she must unmake again: and yet, good and wise woman
as she is, she never frets, nor tires, nor fudges her work, as we say
at school.&nbsp; She takes just as much pains to make an acorn as to
make a peach.&nbsp; She takes just as much pains about the acorn which
the pig eats, as about the acorn which will grow into a tall oak, and
help to build a great ship.&nbsp; She took just as much pains, again,
about the acorn which you crushed under your foot just now, and which
you fancy will never come to anything.&nbsp; Madam How is wiser than
that.&nbsp; She knows that it will come to something.&nbsp; She will
find some use for it, as she finds a use for everything.&nbsp; That
acorn which you crushed will turn into mould, and that mould will go
to feed the roots of some plant, perhaps next year, if it lies where
it is; or perhaps it will be washed into the brook, and then into the
river, and go down to the sea, and will feed the roots of some plant
in some new continent ages and ages hence: and so Madam How will have
her own again.&nbsp; You dropped your stick into the river yesterday,
and it floated away.&nbsp; You were sorry, because it had cost you a
great deal of trouble to cut it, and peel it, and carve a head and your
name on it.&nbsp; Madam How was not sorry, though she had taken a great
deal more trouble with that stick than ever you had taken.&nbsp; She
had been three years making that stick, out of many things, sunbeams
among the rest.&nbsp; But when it fell into the river, Madam How knew
that she should not lose her sunbeams nor anything else: the stick would
float down the river, and on into the sea; and there, when it got heavy
with the salt water, it would sink, and lodge, and be buried, and perhaps
ages hence turn into coal; and ages after that some one would dig it
up and burn it, and then out would come, as bright warm flame, all the
sunbeams that were stored away in that stick: and so Madam How would
have her own again.&nbsp; And if that should not be the fate of your
stick, still something else will happen to it just as useful in the
long run; for Madam How never loses anything, but uses up all her scraps
and odds and ends somehow, somewhere, somewhen, as is fit and proper
for the Housekeeper of the whole Universe.&nbsp; Indeed, Madam How is
so patient that some people fancy her stupid, and think that, because
she does not fall into a passion every time you steal her sweets, or
break her crockery, or disarrange her furniture, therefore she does
not care.&nbsp; But I advise you as a little boy, and still more when
you grow up to be a man, not to get that fancy into your head; for you
will find that, however good-natured and patient Madam How is in most
matters, her keeping silence and not seeming to see you is no sign that
she has forgotten.&nbsp; On the contrary, she bears a grudge (if one
may so say, with all respect to her) longer than any one else does;
because she will always have her own again.&nbsp; Indeed, I sometimes
think that if it were not for Lady Why, her mistress, she might bear
some of her grudges for ever and ever.&nbsp; I have seen men ere now
damage some of Madam How&rsquo;s property when they were little boys,
and be punished by her all their lives long, even though she had mended
the broken pieces, or turned them to some other use.&nbsp; Therefore
I say to you, beware of Madam How.&nbsp; She will teach you more kindly,
patiently, and tenderly than any mother, if you want to learn her trade.&nbsp;
But if, instead of learning her trade, you damage her materials and
play with her tools, beware lest she has her own again out of you.</p>
<p>Some people think, again, that Madam How is not only stupid, but
ill-tempered and cruel; that she makes earthquakes and storms, and famine
and pestilences, in a sort of blind passion, not caring where they go
or whom they hurt; quite heedless of who is in the way, if she wants
to do anything or go anywhere.&nbsp; Now, that Madam How can be very
terrible there can be no doubt: but there is no doubt also that, if
people choose to learn, she will teach them to get out of her way whenever
she has business to do which is dangerous to them.&nbsp; But as for
her being cruel and unjust, those may believe it who like.&nbsp; You,
my dear boys and girls, need not believe it, if you will only trust
to Lady Why; and be sure that Why is the mistress and How the servant,
now and for ever.&nbsp; That Lady Why is utterly good and kind I know
full well; and I believe that, in her case too, the old proverb holds,
&ldquo;Like mistress, like servant;&rdquo; and that the more we know
of Madam How, the more we shall be content with her, and ready to submit
to whatever she does: but not with that stupid resignation which some
folks preach who do not believe in lady Why&mdash;that is no resignation
at all.&nbsp; That is merely saying&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What can&rsquo;t be cured<br />
Must be endured,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>like a donkey when he turns his tail to a hail-storm,&mdash;but the
true resignation, the resignation which is fit for grown people and
children alike, the resignation which is the beginning and the end of
all wisdom and all religion, is to believe that Lady Why knows best,
because she herself is perfectly good; and that as she is mistress over
Madam How, so she has a Master over her, whose name&mdash;I say again&mdash;I
leave you to guess.</p>
<p>So now that I have taught you not to be afraid of Madam How, we will
go and watch her at her work; and if we do not understand anything we
see, we will ask her questions.&nbsp; She will always show us one of
her lesson books if we give her time.&nbsp; And if we have to wait some
time for her answer, you need not fear catching cold, though it is November;
for she keeps her lesson books scattered about in strange places, and
we may have to walk up and down that hill more than once before we can
make out how she makes the glen.</p>
<p>Well&mdash;how was the glen made?&nbsp; You shall guess it if you
like, and I will guess too.&nbsp; You think, perhaps, that an earthquake
opened it?</p>
<p>My dear child, we must look before we guess.&nbsp; Then, after we
have looked a little, and got some grounds for guessing, then we may
guess.&nbsp; And you have no ground for supposing there ever was an
earthquake here strong enough to open that glen.&nbsp; There may have
been one: but we must guess from what we do know, and not from what
we do not.</p>
<p>Guess again.&nbsp; Perhaps it was there always, from the beginning
of the world?&nbsp; My dear child, you have no proof of that either.&nbsp;
Everything round you is changing in shape daily and hourly, as you will
find out the longer you live; and therefore it is most reasonable to
suppose that this glen has changed its shape, as everything else on
earth has done.&nbsp; Besides, I told you not that Madam How had made
the glen, but that she was making it, and as yet has only half finished.&nbsp;
That is my first guess; and my next guess is that water is making the
glen&mdash;water, and nothing else.</p>
<p>You open your young eyes.&nbsp; And I do not blame you.&nbsp; I looked
at this very glen for fifteen years before I made that guess; and I
have looked at it some ten years since, to make sure that my guess held
good.&nbsp; For man after all is very blind, my dear boy, and very stupid,
and cannot see what lies under his own feet all day long; and if Lady
Why, and He whom Lady Why obeys, were not very patient and gentle with
mankind, they would have perished off the face of the earth long ago,
simply from their own stupidity.&nbsp; I, at least, was very stupid
in this case, for I had my head full of earthquakes, and convulsions
of nature, and all sorts of prodigies which never happened to this glen;
and so, while I was trying to find what was not there, I of course found
nothing.&nbsp; But when I put them all out of my head, and began to
look for what was there, I found it at once; and lo and behold! I had
seen it a thousand times before, and yet never learnt anything from
it, like a stupid man as I was; though what I learnt you may learn as
easily as I did.</p>
<p>And what did I find?</p>
<p>The pond at the bottom of the glen.</p>
<p>You know that pond, of course?&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t need to go there?&nbsp;
Very well.&nbsp; Then if you do, do not you know also that the pond
is always filling up with sand and mud; and that though we clean it
out every three or four years, it always fills again?&nbsp; Now where
does that sand and mud come from?</p>
<p>Down that stream, of course, which runs out of this bog.&nbsp; You
see it coming down every time there is a flood, and the stream fouls.</p>
<p>Very well.&nbsp; Then, said Madam How to me, as soon as I recollected
that, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see, you stupid man, that the stream has
made the glen, and the earth which runs down the stream was all once
part of the hill on which you stand.&rdquo;&nbsp; I confess I was very
much ashamed of myself when she said that.&nbsp; For that is the history
of the whole mystery.&nbsp; Madam How is digging away with her soft
spade, water.&nbsp; She has a harder spade, or rather plough, the strongest
and most terrible of all ploughs; but that, I am glad to say, she has
laid by in England here.</p>
<p>Water?&nbsp; But water is too simple a thing to have dug out all
this great glen.</p>
<p>My dear child, the most wonderful part of Madam How&rsquo;s work
is, that she does such great things and so many different things, with
one and the same tool, which looks to you so simple, though it really
is not so.&nbsp; Water, for instance, is not a simple thing, but most
complicated; and we might spend hours in talking about water, without
having come to the end of its wonders.&nbsp; Still Madam How is a great
economist, and never wastes her materials.&nbsp; She is like the sailor
who boasted (only she never boasts) that, if he had but a long life
and a strong knife, he would build St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral before
he was done.&nbsp; And Madam How has a very long life, and plenty of
time; and one of the strongest of all her tools is water.&nbsp; Now
if you will stoop down and look into the heather, I will show you how
she is digging out the glen with this very mist which is hanging about
our feet.&nbsp; At least, so I guess.</p>
<p>For see how the mist clings to the points of the heather leaves,
and makes drops.&nbsp; If the hot sun came out the drops would dry,
and they would vanish into the air in light warm steam.&nbsp; But now
that it is dark and cold they drip, or run down the heather-stems, to
the ground.&nbsp; And whither do they go then?&nbsp; Whither will the
water go,&mdash;hundreds of gallons of it perhaps,&mdash;which has dripped
and run through the heather in this single day?&nbsp; It will sink into
the ground, you know.&nbsp; And then what will become of it?&nbsp; Madam
How will use it as an underground spade, just as she uses the rain (at
least, when it rains too hard, and therefore the rain runs off the moor
instead of sinking into it) as a spade above ground.</p>
<p>Now come to the edge of the glen, and I will show you the mist that
fell yesterday, perhaps, coming out of the ground again, and hard at
work.</p>
<p>You know of what an odd, and indeed of what a pretty form all these
glens are.&nbsp; How the flat moor ends suddenly in a steep rounded
bank, almost like the crest of a wave&mdash;ready like a wave-crest
to fall over, and as you know, falling over sometimes, bit by bit, where
the soil is bare.</p>
<p>Oh, yes; you are very fond of those banks.&nbsp; It is &ldquo;awfully
jolly,&rdquo; as you say, scrambling up and down them, in the deep heath
and fern; besides, there are plenty of rabbit-holes there, because they
are all sand; while there are no rabbit-holes on the flat above, because
it is all gravel.</p>
<p>Yes; you know all about it: but you know, too, that you must not
go too far down these banks, much less roll down them, because there
is almost certain to be a bog at the bottom, lying upon a gentle slope;
and there you get wet through.</p>
<p>All round these hills, from here to Aldershot in one direction, and
from here to Windsor in another, you see the same shaped glens; the
wave-crest along their top, and at the foot of the crest a line of springs
which run out over the slopes, or well up through them in deep sand-galls,
as you call them&mdash;shaking quagmires which are sometimes deep enough
to swallow up a horse, and which you love to dance upon in summer time.&nbsp;
Now the water of all these springs is nothing but the rain, and mist,
and dew, which has sunk down first through the peaty soil, and then
through the gravel and sand, and there has stopped.&nbsp; And why?&nbsp;
Because under the gravel (about which I will tell you a strange story
one day) and under the sand, which is what the geologists call the Upper
Bagshot sand, there is an entirely different set of beds, which geologists
call the Bracklesham beds, from a place near the New Forest; and in
those beds there is a vein of clay, and through that clay the water
cannot get, as you have seen yourself when we dug it out in the field
below to puddle the pond-head; and very good fun you thought it, and
a very pretty mess you made of yourself.&nbsp; Well: because the water
cannot get though this clay, and must go somewhere, it runs out continually
along the top of the clay, and as it runs undermines the bank, and brings
down sand and gravel continually for the next shower to wash into the
stream below.</p>
<p>Now think for one moment how wonderful it is that the shape of these
glens, of which you are so fond, was settled by the particular order
in which Madam How laid down the gravel and sand and mud at the bottom
of the sea, ages and ages ago.&nbsp; This is what I told you, that the
least thing that Madam How does to-day may take effect hundreds and
thousands of years hence.</p>
<p>But I must tell you I think there was a time when this glen was of
a very different shape from what it is now; and I dare say, according
to your notions, of a much prettier shape.&nbsp; It was once just like
one of those Chines which we used to see at Bournemouth.&nbsp; You recollect
them?&nbsp; How there was a narrow gap in the cliff of striped sands
and gravels; and out of the mouth of that gap, only a few feet across,
there poured down a great slope of mud and sand the shape of half a
bun, some wet and some dry, up which we used to scramble and get into
the Chine, and call the Chine what it was in the truest sense, Fairyland.&nbsp;
You recollect how it was all eaten out into mountain ranges, pinnacles,
steep cliffs of white, and yellow, and pink, standing up against the
clear blue sky; till we agreed that, putting aside the difference of
size, they were as beautiful and grand as any Alps we had ever seen
in pictures.&nbsp; And how we saw (for there could be no mistake about
it there) that the Chine was being hollowed out by the springs which
broke out high up the cliff, and by the rain which wore the sand into
furrowed pinnacles and peaks.&nbsp; You recollect the beautiful place,
and how, when we looked back down it we saw between the miniature mountain
walls the bright blue sea, and heard it murmur on the sands outside.&nbsp;
So I verily believe we might have done, if we had stood somewhere at
the bottom of this glen thousands of years ago.&nbsp; We should have
seen the sea in front of us; or rather, an arm of the sea; for Finchampstead
ridges opposite, instead of being covered with farms, and woodlands,
and purple heath above, would have been steep cliffs of sand and clay,
just like those you see at Bournemouth now; and&mdash;what would have
spoilt somewhat the beauty of the sight&mdash;along the shores there
would have floated, at least in winter, great blocks and floes of ice,
such as you might have seen in the tideway at King&rsquo;s Lynn the
winter before last, growling and crashing, grubbing and ploughing the
sand, and the gravel, and the mud, and sweeping them away into seas
towards the North, which are now all fruitful land.&nbsp; That may seem
to you like a dream: yet it is true; and some day, when we have another
talk with Madam How, I will show even a child like you that it was true.</p>
<p>But what could change a beautiful Chine like that at Bournemouth
into a wide sloping glen like this of Bracknell&rsquo;s Bottom, with
a wood like Coombs&rsquo;, many acres large, in the middle of it?&nbsp;
Well now, think.&nbsp; It is a capital plan for finding out Madam How&rsquo;s
secrets, to see what she might do in one place, and explain by it what
she has done in another.&nbsp; Suppose now, Madam How had orders to
lift up the whole coast of Bournemouth only twenty or even ten feet
higher out of the sea than it is now.&nbsp; She could do that easily
enough, for she has been doing so on the coast of South America for
ages; she has been doing so this very summer in what hasty people would
call a hasty, and violent, and ruthless way; though I shall not say
so, for I believe that Lady Why knows best.&nbsp; She is doing so now
steadily on the west coast of Norway, which is rising quietly&mdash;all
that vast range of mountain wall and iron-bound cliff&mdash;at the rate
of some four feet in a hundred years, without making the least noise
or confusion, or even causing an extra ripple on the sea; so light and
gentle, when she will, can Madam How&rsquo;s strong finger be.</p>
<p>Now, if the mouth of that Chine at Bournemouth was lifted twenty
feet out of the sea, one thing would happen,&mdash;that the high tide
would not come up any longer, and wash away the cake of dirt at the
entrance, as we saw it do so often.&nbsp; But if the mud stopped there,
the mud behind it would come down more slowly, and lodge inside more
and more, till the Chine was half filled-up, and only the upper part
of the cliffs continue to be eaten away, above the level where the springs
ran out.&nbsp; So gradually the Chine, instead of being deep and narrow,
would become broad and shallow; and instead of hollowing itself rapidly
after every shower of rain, as you saw the Chine at Bournemouth doing,
would hollow itself out slowly, as this glen is doing now.&nbsp; And
one thing more would happen,&mdash;when the sea ceased to gnaw at the
foot of the cliffs outside, and to carry away every stone and grain
of sand which fell from them, the cliffs would very soon cease to be
cliffs; the rain and the frost would still crumble them down, but the
dirt that fell would lie at their feet, and gradually make a slope of
dry land, far out where the shallow sea had been; and their tops, instead
of being steep as now, would become smooth and rounded; and so at last,
instead of two sharp walls of cliff at the Chine&rsquo;s mouth, you
might have&mdash;just what you have here at the mouth of this glen,&mdash;our
Mount and the Warren Hill,&mdash;long slopes with sheets of drifted
gravel and sand at their feet, stretching down into what was once an
icy sea, and is now the Vale of Blackwater.&nbsp; And this I really
believe Madam How has done simply by lifting Hartford Bridge Flat a
few more feet out of the sea, and leaving the rest to her trusty tool,
the water in the sky.</p>
<p>That is my guess: and I think it is a good guess, because I have
asked Madam How a hundred different questions about it in the last ten
years, and she always answered them in the same way, saying, &ldquo;Water,
water, you stupid man.&rdquo;&nbsp; But I do not want you merely to
depend on what I say.&nbsp; If you want to understand Madam How, you
must ask her questions yourself, and make up your mind yourself like
a man, instead of taking things at hearsay or second-hand, like the
vulgar.&nbsp; Mind, by &ldquo;the vulgar&rdquo; I do not mean poor people:
I mean ignorant and uneducated people, who do not use their brains rightly,
though they may be fine ladies, kings, or popes.&nbsp; The Bible says,
&ldquo;Prove all things: hold fast that which is good.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So do you prove my guess, and if it proves good, hold it fast.</p>
<p>And how can I do that?</p>
<p>First, by direct experiment, as it is called.&nbsp; In plain English&mdash;go
home and make a little Hartford Bridge Flat in the stable-yard; and
then ask Mrs. How if she will not make a glen in it like this glen here.&nbsp;
We will go home and try that.&nbsp; We will make a great flat cake of
clay, and put upon it a cap of sand; and then we will rain upon it out
of a watering-pot; and see if Mrs. How does not begin soon to make a
glen in the side of the heap, just like those on Hartford Bridge Flat.&nbsp;
I believe she will; and certainly, if she does, it will be a fresh proof
that my guess is right.&nbsp; And then we will see whether water will
not make glens of a different shape than these, if it run over soils
of a different kind.&nbsp; We will make a Hartford Bridge Flat turned
upside down&mdash;a cake of sand with a cap of clay on the top; and
we will rain on that out of our watering-pot, and see what sort of glens
we make then.&nbsp; I can guess what they will be like, because I have
seen them&mdash;steep overhanging cliffs, with very narrow gullies down
them: but you shall try for yourself, and make up your mind whether
you think me right or wrong.&nbsp; Meanwhile, remember that those gullies
too will have been made by water.</p>
<p>And there is another way of &ldquo;verifying my theory,&rdquo; as
it is called; in plain English, seeing if my guess holds good; that
is, to look at other valleys&mdash;not merely the valleys round here,
but valleys in clay, in chalk, in limestone, in the hard slate rock
such as you saw in Devonshire&mdash;and see whether my guess does not
hold good about them too; whether all of them, deep or shallow, broad
or narrow, rock or earth, may not have been all hollowed out by running
water.&nbsp; I am sure if you would do this you would find something
to amuse you, and something to instruct you, whenever you wish.&nbsp;
I know that I do.&nbsp; To me the longest railroad journey, instead
of being stupid, is like continually turning over the leaves of a wonderful
book, or looking at wonderful pictures of old worlds which were made
and unmade thousands of years ago.&nbsp; For I keep looking, not only
at the railway cuttings, where the bones of the old worlds are laid
bare, but at the surface of the ground; at the plains and downs, banks
and knolls, hills and mountains; and continually asking Mrs. How what
gave them each its shape: and I will soon teach you to do the same.&nbsp;
When you do, I tell you fairly her answer will be in almost every case,
&ldquo;Running water.&rdquo;&nbsp; Either water running when soft, as
it usually is; or water running when it is hard&mdash;in plain words,
moving ice.</p>
<p>About that moving ice, which is Mrs. How&rsquo;s stronger spade,
I will tell you some other time; and show you, too, the marks of it
in every gravel pit about here.&nbsp; But now, I see, you want to ask
a question; and what is it?</p>
<p>Do I mean to say that water has made great valleys, such as you have
seen paintings and photographs of,&mdash;valleys thousands of feet deep,
among mountains thousands of feet high?</p>
<p>Yes, I do.&nbsp; But, as I said before, I do not like you to take
my word upon trust.&nbsp; When you are older you shall go to the mountains,
and you shall judge for yourself.&nbsp; Still, I must say that I never
saw a valley, however deep, or a cliff, however high, which had not
been scooped out by water; and that even the mountain-tops which stand
up miles aloft in jagged peaks and pinnacles against the sky were cut
out at first, and are being cut and sharpened still, by little else
save water, soft and hard; that is, by rain, frost, and ice.</p>
<p>Water, and nothing else, has sawn out such a chasm as that through
which the ships run up to Bristol, between Leigh Wood and St. Vincent&rsquo;s
Rocks.&nbsp; Water, and nothing else, has shaped those peaks of the
Matterhorn, or the Weisshorn, or the Pic du Midi of the Pyrenees, of
which you have seen sketches and photographs.&nbsp; Just so water might
saw out Hartford Bridge Flat, if it had time enough, into a labyrinth
of valleys, and hills, and peaks standing alone; as it has done already
by Ambarrow, and Edgbarrow, and the Folly Hill on the other side of
the vale.</p>
<p>I see you are astonished at the notion that water can make Alps.&nbsp;
But it was just because I knew you would be astonished at Madam How&rsquo;s
doing so great a thing with so simple a tool, that I began by showing
you how she was doing the same thing in a small way here upon these
flats.&nbsp; For the safest way to learn Madam How&rsquo;s methods is
to watch her at work in little corners at commonplace business, which
will not astonish or frighten us, nor put huge hasty guesses and dreams
into our heads.&nbsp; Sir Isaac Newton, some will tell you, found out
the great law of gravitation, which holds true of all the suns and stars
in heaven, by watching an apple fall: and even if he did not find it
out so, he found it out, we know, by careful thinking over the plain
and commonplace fact, that things have weight.&nbsp; So do you be humble
and patient, and watch Madam How at work on little things.&nbsp; For
that is the way to see her at work upon all space and time.</p>
<p>What? you have a question more to ask?</p>
<p>Oh!&nbsp; I talked about Madam How lifting up Hartford Bridge Flat.&nbsp;
How could she do that?&nbsp; My dear child, that is a long story, and
I must tell it you some other time.&nbsp; Meanwhile, did you ever see
the lid of a kettle rise up and shake when the water inside boiled?&nbsp;
Of course; and of course, too, remember that Madam How must have done
it.&nbsp; Then think over between this and our next talk, what that
can possibly have to do with her lifting up Hartford Bridge Flat.&nbsp;
But you have been longing, perhaps, all this time to hear more about
Lady Why, and why she set Madam How to make Bracknell&rsquo;s Bottom.</p>
<p>My dear child, the only answer I dare give to that is: Whatever other
purposes she may have made it for, she made it at least for this&mdash;that
you and I should come to it this day, and look at, and talk over it,
and become thereby wiser and more earnest, and we will hope more humble
and better people.&nbsp; Whatever else Lady Why may wish or not wish,
this she wishes always, to make all men wise and all men good.&nbsp;
For what is written of her whom, as in a parable, I have called Lady
Why?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord possessed me in the beginning of His way, before
His works of old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever
the earth was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there
were no fountains abounding with water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I
brought forth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;While as yet He had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor
the highest part of the dust of the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When He prepared the heavens, I was there: when He set a compass
upon the face of the depth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When He established the clouds above: when He strengthened
the fountains of the deep:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When He gave to the sea His decree, that the waters should
not pass His commandment: when He appointed the foundations of the earth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I was by Him, as one brought up with Him: and I was daily
His delight, rejoicing always before Him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rejoicing in the habitable part of His earth; and my delights
were with the sons of men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed
are they that keep my ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That we can say, for it has been said for us already.&nbsp; But beyond
that we can say, and need say, very little.&nbsp; We were not there,
as we read in the Book of Job, when God laid the foundations of the
earth.&nbsp; &ldquo;We see,&rdquo; says St. Paul, &ldquo;as in a glass
darkly, and only know in part.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;For who,&rdquo; he
asks again, &ldquo;has known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been
His counsellor? . . . For of Him, and through Him, and to Him, are all
things: to whom be glory for ever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Therefore we must not rashly say, this or that is Why a thing has happened;
nor invent what are called &ldquo;final causes,&rdquo; which are not
Lady Why herself, but only our little notions of what Lady Why has done,
or rather what we should have done if we had been in her place.&nbsp;
It is not, indeed, by thinking that we shall find out anything about
Lady Why.&nbsp; She speaks not to our eyes or to our brains, like Madam
How, but to that inner part of us which we call our hearts and spirits,
and which will endure when eyes and brain are turned again to dust.&nbsp;
If your heart be pure and sober, gentle and truthful, then Lady Why
speaks to you without words, and tells you things which Madam How and
all her pupils, the men of science, can never tell.&nbsp; When you lie,
it may be, on a painful sick-bed, but with your mother&rsquo;s hand
in yours; when you sit by her, looking up into her loving eyes; when
you gaze out towards the setting sun, and fancy golden capes and islands
in the clouds, and seas and lakes in the blue sky, and the infinite
rest and peace of the far west sends rest and peace into your young
heart, till you sit silent and happy, you know not why; when sweet music
fills your heart with noble and tender instincts which need no thoughts
or words; ay, even when you watch the raging thunderstorm, and feel
it to be, in spite of its great awfulness, so beautiful that you cannot
turn your eyes away: at such times as these Lady Why is speaking to
your soul of souls, and saying, &ldquo;My child, this world is a new
place, and strange, and often terrible: but be not afraid.&nbsp; All
will come right at last.&nbsp; Rest will conquer Restlessness; Faith
will conquer Fear; Order will conquer Disorder; Health will conquer
Sickness; Joy will conquer Sorrow; Pleasure will conquer Pain; Life
will conquer Death; Right will conquer Wrong.&nbsp; All will be well
at last.&nbsp; Keep your soul and body pure, humble, busy, pious&mdash;in
one word, be good: and ere you die, or after you die, you may have some
glimpse of Me, the Everlasting Why: and hear with the ears, not of your
body but of your spirit, men and all rational beings, plants and animals,
ay, the very stones beneath your feet, the clouds above your head, the
planets and the suns away in farthest space, singing eternally,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour
and power, for Thou hast created all things, and for Thy pleasure they
are and were created.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II&mdash;EARTHQUAKES</h2>
<p>So?&nbsp; You have been looking at that beautiful drawing of the
ruin of Arica in the <i>Illustrated London News</i>: and it has puzzled
you and made you sad.&nbsp; You want to know why God killed all those
people&mdash;mothers among them, too, and little children?</p>
<p>Alas, my dear child! who am I that I should answer you that?</p>
<p>Have you done wrong in asking me?&nbsp; No, my dear child; no.&nbsp;
You have asked me because you are a human being and a child of God,
and not merely a cleverer sort of animal, an ape who can read and write
and cast accounts.&nbsp; Therefore it is that you cannot be content,
and ought not to be content, with asking how things happen, but must
go on to ask why.&nbsp; You cannot be content with knowing the causes
of things; and if you knew all the natural science that ever was or
ever will be known to men, that would not satisfy you; for it would
only tell you the <i>causes</i> of things, while your souls want to
know the <i>reasons</i> of things besides; and though I may not be able
to tell you the reasons of things, or show you aught but a tiny glimpse
here and there of that which I called the other day the glory of Lady
Why, yet I believe that somehow, somewhen, somewhere, you will learn
something of the reason of things.&nbsp; For that thirst to know <i>why</i>
was put into the hearts of little children by God Himself; and I believe
that God would never have given them that thirst if He had not meant
to satisfy it.</p>
<p>There&mdash;you do not understand me.&nbsp; I trust that you will
understand me some day.&nbsp; Meanwhile, I think&mdash;I only say I
<i>think</i>&mdash;you know I told you how humble we must be whenever
we speak of Lady Why&mdash;that we may guess at something like a good
reason for the terrible earthquakes in South America.&nbsp; I do not
wish to be hard upon poor people in great affliction: but I cannot help
thinking that they have been doing for hundreds of years past something
very like what the Bible calls &ldquo;tempting God&rdquo;&mdash;staking
their property and their lives upon the chances of no earthquakes coming,
while they ought to have known that an earthquake might come any day.&nbsp;
They have fulfilled (and little thought I that it would be fulfilled
so soon) the parable that I told you once, of the nation of the Do-as-you-likes,
who lived careless and happy at the foot of the burning mountain, and
would not be warned by the smoke that came out of the top, or by the
slag and cinders which lay all about them; till the mountain blew up,
and destroyed them miserably.</p>
<p>Then I think that they ought to have expected an earthquake.</p>
<p>Well&mdash;it is not for us to judge any one, especially if they
live in a part of the world in which we have not been ourselves.&nbsp;
But I think that we know, and that they ought to have known, enough
about earthquakes to have been more prudent than they have been for
many a year.&nbsp; At least we will hope that, though they would not
learn their lesson till this year, they will learn it now, and will
listen to the message which I think Madam How has brought them, spoken
in a voice of thunder, and written in letters of flame.</p>
<p>And what is that?</p>
<p>My dear child, if the landlord of our house was in the habit of pulling
the roof down upon our heads, and putting gunpowder under the foundations
to blow us up, do you not think we should know what he meant, even though
he never spoke a word?&nbsp; He would be very wrong in behaving so,
of course: but one thing would be certain,&mdash;that he did not intend
us to live in his house any longer if he could help it; and was giving
us, in a very rough fashion, notice to quit.&nbsp; And so it seems to
me that these poor Spanish Americans have received from the Landlord
of all landlords, who can do no wrong, such a notice to quit as perhaps
no people ever had before; which says to them in unmistakable words,
&ldquo;You must leave this country: or perish.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I believe
that that message, like all Lady Why&rsquo;s messages, is at heart a
merciful and loving one; that if these Spaniards would leave the western
coast of Peru, and cross the Andes into the green forests of the eastern
side of their own land, they might not only live free from earthquakes,
but (if they would only be good and industrious) become a great, rich,
and happy nation, instead of the idle, and useless, and I am afraid
not over good, people which they have been.&nbsp; For in that eastern
part of their own land God&rsquo;s gifts are waiting for them, in a
paradise such as I can neither describe nor you conceive;&mdash;precious
woods, fruits, drugs, and what not&mdash;boundless wealth, in one word&mdash;waiting
for them to send it all down the waters of the mighty river Amazon,
enriching us here in the Old World, and enriching themselves there in
the New.&nbsp; If they would only go and use these gifts of God, instead
of neglecting them as they have been doing for now three hundred years,
they would be a blessing to the earth, instead of being&mdash;that which
they have been.</p>
<p>God grant, my dear child, that these poor people may take the warning
that has been sent to them; &ldquo;The voice of God revealed in facts,&rdquo;
as the great Lord Bacon would have called it, and see not only that
God has bidden them leave the place where they are now, but has prepared
for them, in their own land, a home a thousand times better than that
in which they now live.</p>
<p>But you ask, How ought they to have known that an earthquake would
come?</p>
<p>Well, to make you understand that, we must talk a little about earthquakes,
and what makes them; and in order to find out that, let us try the very
simplest cause of which we can think.&nbsp; That is the wise and scientific
plan.</p>
<p>Now, whatever makes these earthquakes must be enormously strong;
that is certain.&nbsp; And what is the strongest thing you know of in
the world?&nbsp; Think . . .</p>
<p>Gunpowder?</p>
<p>Well, gunpowder is strong sometimes: but not always.&nbsp; You may
carry it in a flask, or in your hand, and then it is weak enough.&nbsp;
It only becomes strong by being turned into gas and steam.&nbsp; But
steam is always strong.&nbsp; And if you look at a railway engine, still
more if you had ever seen&mdash;which God forbid you should&mdash;a
boiler explosion, you would agree with me, that the strongest thing
we know of in the world is steam.</p>
<p>Now I think that we can explain almost, if not quite, all that we
know about earthquakes, if we believe that on the whole they are caused
by steam and other gases expanding, that is, spreading out, with wonderful
quickness and strength.&nbsp; Of course there must be something to make
them expand, and that is <i>heat</i>.&nbsp; But we will not talk of
that yet.</p>
<p>Now do you remember that riddle which I put to you the other day?&mdash;&ldquo;What
had the rattling of the lid of the kettle to do with Hartford Bridge
Flat being lifted out of the ancient sea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer to the riddle, I believe, is&mdash;Steam has done both.&nbsp;
The lid of the kettle rattles, because the expanding steam escapes in
little jets, and so causes a <i>lid-quake</i>.&nbsp; Now suppose that
there was steam under the earth trying to escape, and the earth in one
place was loose and yet hard, as the lid of the kettle is loose and
yet hard, with cracks in it, it may be, like the crack between the edge
of the lid and the edge of the kettle itself: might not the steam try
to escape through the cracks, and rattle the surface of the earth, and
so cause an <i>earthquake</i>?</p>
<p>So the steam would escape generally easily, and would only make a
passing rattle, like the earthquake of which the famous jester Charles
Selwyn said that it was quite a young one, so tame that you might have
stroked it; like that which I myself once felt in the Pyrenees, which
gave me very solemn thoughts after a while, though at first I did nothing
but laugh at it; and I will tell you why.</p>
<p>I was travelling in the Pyrenees; and I came one evening to the loveliest
spot&mdash;a glen, or rather a vast crack in the mountains, so narrow
that there was no room for anything at the bottom of it, save a torrent
roaring between walls of polished rock.&nbsp; High above the torrent
the road was cut out among the cliffs, and above the road rose more
cliffs, with great black cavern mouths, hundreds of feet above our heads,
out of each of which poured in foaming waterfalls streams large enough
to turn a mill, and above them mountains piled on mountains, all covered
with woods of box, which smelt rich and hot and musky in the warm spring
air.&nbsp; Among the box-trees and fallen boulders grew hepaticas, blue
and white and red, such as you see in the garden; and little stars of
gentian, more azure than the azure sky.&nbsp; But out of the box-woods
above rose giant silver firs, clothing the cliffs and glens with tall
black spires, till they stood out at last in a jagged saw-edge against
the purple evening sky, along the mountain ranges, thousands of feet
aloft; and beyond them again, at the head of the valley, rose vast cones
of virgin snow, miles away in reality, but looking so brilliant and
so near that one fancied at the first moment that one could have touched
them with one&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; Snow-white they stood, the glorious
things, seven thousand feet into the air; and I watched their beautiful
white sides turn rose-colour in the evening sun, and when he set, fade
into dull cold gray, till the bright moon came out to light them up
once more.&nbsp; When I was tired of wondering and admiring, I went
into bed; and there I had a dream&mdash;such a dream as Alice had when
she went into Wonderland&mdash;such a dream as I dare say you may have
had ere now.&nbsp; Some noise or stir puts into your fancy as you sleep
a whole long dream to account for it; and yet that dream, which seems
to you to be hours long, has not taken up a second of time; for the
very same noise which begins the dream, wakes you at the end of it:
and so it was with me.&nbsp; I dreamed that some English people had
come into the hotel where I was, and were sleeping in the room underneath
me; and that they had quarrelled and fought, and broke their bed down
with a tremendous crash, and that I must get up, and stop the fight;
and at that moment I woke and heard coming up the valley from the north
such a roar as I never heard before or since; as if a hundred railway
trains were rolling underground; and just as it passed under my bed
there was a tremendous thump, and I jumped out of bed quicker than I
ever did in my life, and heard the roaring sound die away as it rolled
up the valley towards the peaks of snow.&nbsp; Still I had in my head
this notion of the Englishmen fighting in the room below.&nbsp; But
then I recollected that no Englishmen had come in the night before,
and that I had been in the room below, and that there was no bed in
it.&nbsp; Then I opened my window&mdash;a woman screamed, a dog barked,
some cocks and hens cackled in a very disturbed humour, and then I could
hear nothing but the roaring of the torrent a hundred feet below.&nbsp;
And then it flashed across me what all the noise was about; and I burst
out laughing and said &ldquo;It is only an earthquake,&rdquo; and went
to bed</p>
<p>Next morning I inquired whether any one had heard a noise.&nbsp;
No, nobody had heard anything.&nbsp; And the driver who had brought
me up the valley only winked, but did not choose to speak.&nbsp; At
last at breakfast I asked the pretty little maid who waited what was
the meaning of the noise I heard in the night, and she answered, to
my intense amusement, &ldquo;Ah! bah! ce n&rsquo;etait qu&rsquo;un tremblement
de terre; il y en a ici toutes les six semaines.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now the
secret was out.&nbsp; The little maid, I found, came from the lowland
far away, and did not mind telling the truth: but the good people of
the place were afraid to let out that they had earthquakes every six
weeks, for fear of frightening visitors away: and because they were
really very good people, and very kind to me, I shall not tell you what
the name of the place is.</p>
<p>Of course after that I could do no less than ask Madam How, very
civilly, how she made earthquakes in that particular place, hundreds
of miles away from any burning mountain?&nbsp; And this was the answer
I <i>thought</i> she gave, though I am not so conceited as to say I
am sure.</p>
<p>As I had come up the valley I had seen that the cliffs were all beautiful
gray limestone marble; but just at this place they were replaced by
granite, such as you may see in London Bridge or at Aberdeen.&nbsp;
I do not mean that the limestone changed to granite, but that the granite
had risen up out of the bottom of the valley, and had carried the limestone
(I suppose) up on its back hundreds of feet into the air.&nbsp; Those
caves with the waterfalls pouring from their mouths were all on one
level, at the top of the granite, and the bottom of the limestone.&nbsp;
That was to be expected; for, as I will explain to you some day, water
can make caves easily in limestone: but never, I think, in granite.&nbsp;
But I knew that besides these cold springs which came out of the caves,
there were hot springs also, full of curious chemical salts, just below
the very house where I was in.&nbsp; And when I went to look at them,
I found that they came out of the rock just where the limestone and
the granite joined.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;now I think
I have Madam How&rsquo;s answer.&nbsp; The lid of one of her great steam
boilers is rather shaky and cracked just here, because the granite has
broken and torn the limestone as it lifted it up; and here is the hot
water out of the boiler actually oozing out of the crack; and the earthquake
I heard last night was simply the steam rumbling and thumping inside,
and trying to get out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, my dear child, I fell into a more serious mood.&nbsp; I
said to myself, &ldquo;If that stream had been a little, only a little
stronger, or if the rock above it had been only a little weaker, it
would have been no laughing matter then; the village might have been
shaken to the ground; the rocks hurled into the torrent; jets of steam
and of hot water, mixed, it may be, with deadly gases, have roared out
of the riven ground; that might have happened here, in short, which
has happened and happens still in a hundred places in the world, whenever
the rocks are too weak to stand the pressure of the steam below, and
the solid earth bursts as an engine boiler bursts when the steam within
it is too strong.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when those thoughts came into my
mind, I was in no humour to jest any more about &ldquo;young earthquakes,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Madam How&rsquo;s boilers;&rdquo; but rather to say with the
wise man of old, &ldquo;It is of the Lord&rsquo;s mercies that we are
not consumed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most strange, most terrible also, are the tricks which this underground
steam plays.&nbsp; It will make the ground, which seems to us so hard
and firm, roll and rock in waves, till people are sea-sick, as on board
a ship; and that rocking motion (which is the most common) will often,
when it is but slight, set the bells ringing in the steeples, or make
the furniture, and things on shelves, jump about quaintly enough.&nbsp;
It will make trees bend to and fro, as if a wind was blowing through
them; open doors suddenly, and shut them again with a slam; make the
timbers of the floors and roofs creak, as they do in a ship at sea;
or give men such frights as one of the dock-keepers at Liverpool got
in the earthquake in 1863, when his watchbox rocked so, that he thought
some one was going to pitch him over into the dock.&nbsp; But these
are only little hints and warnings of what it can do.&nbsp; When it
is strong enough, it will rock down houses and churches into heaps of
ruins, or, if it leaves them standing, crack them from top to bottom,
so that they must be pulled down and rebuilt.</p>
<p>You saw those pictures of the ruins of Arica, about which our talk
began; and from them you can guess well enough for yourself what a town
looks like which has been ruined by an earthquake.&nbsp; Of the misery
and the horror which follow such a ruin I will not talk to you, nor
darken your young spirit with sad thoughts which grown people must face,
and ought to face.&nbsp; But the strangeness of some of the tricks which
the earthquake shocks play is hardly to be explained, even by scientific
men.&nbsp; Sometimes, it would seem, the force runs round, making the
solid ground eddy, as water eddies in a brook.&nbsp; For it will make
straight rows of trees crooked; it will twist whole walls round&mdash;or
rather the ground on which the walls stand&mdash;without throwing them
down; it will shift the stones of a pillar one on the other sideways,
as if a giant had been trying to spin it like a teetotum, and so screwed
it half in pieces.&nbsp; There is a story told by a wise man, who saw
the place himself, of the whole furniture of one house being hurled
away by an earthquake, and buried under the ruins of another house;
and of things carried hundreds of yards off, so that the neighbours
went to law to settle who was the true owner of them.&nbsp; Sometimes,
again, the shock seems to come neither horizontally in waves, nor circularly
in eddies, but vertically, that is, straight up from below; and then
things&mdash;and people, alas! sometimes&mdash;are thrown up off the
earth high into the air, just as things spring up off the table if you
strike it smartly enough underneath.&nbsp; By that same law (for there
is a law for every sort of motion) it is that the earthquake shock sometimes
hurls great rocks off a cliff into the valley below.&nbsp; The shock
runs through the mountain till it comes to the cliff at the end of it;
and then the face of the cliff, if it be at all loose, flies off into
the air.&nbsp; You may see the very same thing happen, if you will put
marbles or billiard-balls in a row touching each other, and strike the
one nearest you smartly in the line of the row.&nbsp; All the balls
stand still, except the last one, and that flies off.&nbsp; The shock,
like the earthquake shock, has run through them all; but only the end
one, which had nothing beyond it but soft air, has been moved; and when
you grow old, and learn mathematics, you will know the law of motion
according to which that happens, and learn to apply what the billiard-balls
have taught you, to explain the wonders of an earthquake.&nbsp; For
in this case, as in so many more, you must watch Madam How at work on
little and common things, to find out how she works in great and rare
ones.&nbsp; That is why Solomon says that &ldquo;a fool&rsquo;s eyes
are in the ends of the earth,&rdquo; because he is always looking out
for strange things which he has not seen, and which he could not understand
if he saw; instead of looking at the petty commonplace matters which
are about his feet all day long, and getting from them sound knowledge,
and the art of getting more sound knowledge still.</p>
<p>Another terrible destruction which the earthquake brings, when it
is close to the seaside, is the wash of a great sea wave, such as swept
in last year upon the island of St. Thomas, in the West Indies; such
as swept in upon the coast of Peru this year.&nbsp; The sea moans, and
sinks back, leaving the shore dry; and then comes in from the offing
a mighty wall of water, as high as, or higher than, many a tall house;
sweeps far inland, washing away quays and houses, and carrying great
ships in with it; and then sweeps back again, leaving the ships high
and dry, as ships were left in Peru this year.</p>
<p>Now, how is that wave made?&nbsp; Let us think.&nbsp; Perhaps in
many ways.&nbsp; But two of them I will tell you as simply as I can,
because they seem the most likely, and probably the most common.</p>
<p>Suppose, as the earthquake shock ran on, making the earth under the
sea heave and fall in long earth-waves, the sea-bottom sank down.&nbsp;
Then the water on it would sink down too, and leave the shore dry; till
the sea-bottom rose again, and hurled the water up again against the
land.&nbsp; This is one way of explaining it, and it may be true.&nbsp;
For certain it is, that earthquakes do move the bottom of the sea; and
certain, too, that they move the water of the sea also, and with tremendous
force.&nbsp; For ships at sea during an earthquake feel such a blow
from it (though it does them no harm) that the sailors often rush upon
deck fancying that they have struck upon a rock; and the force which
could give a ship, floating in water, such a blow as that, would be
strong enough to hurl thousands of tons of water up the beach, and on
to the land.</p>
<p>But there is another way of accounting for this great sea wave, which
I fancy comes true sometimes.</p>
<p>Suppose you put an empty india-rubber ball into water, and then blow
into it through a pipe.&nbsp; Of course, you know, as the ball filled,
the upper side of it would rise out of the water.&nbsp; Now, suppose
there were a party of little ants moving about upon that ball, and fancying
it a great island, or perhaps the whole world&mdash;what would they
think of the ball&rsquo;s filling and growing bigger?</p>
<p>If they could see the sides of the basin or tub in which the ball
was, and were sure that they did not move, then they would soon judge
by them that they themselves were moving, and that the ball was rising
out of the water.&nbsp; But if the ants were so short-sighted that they
could not see the sides of the basin, they would be apt to make a mistake,
because they would then be like men on an island out of sight of any
other land.&nbsp; Then it would be impossible further to tell whether
they were moving up, or whether the water was moving down; whether their
ball was rising out of the water, or the water was sinking away from
the ball.&nbsp; They would probably say, &ldquo;The water is sinking
and leaving the ball dry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do you understand that?&nbsp; Then think what would happen if you
pricked a hole in the ball.&nbsp; The air inside would come hissing
out, and the ball would sink again into the water.&nbsp; But the ants
would probably fancy the very opposite.&nbsp; Their little heads would
be full of the notion that the ball was solid and could not move, just
as our heads are full of the notion that the earth is solid and cannot
move; and they would say, &ldquo;Ah! here is the water rising again.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Just so, I believe, when the sea seems to ebb away during the earthquake,
the land is really being raised out of the sea, hundreds of miles of
coast, perhaps, or a whole island, at once, by the force of the steam
and gas imprisoned under the ground.&nbsp; That steam stretches and
strains the solid rocks below, till they can bear no more, and snap,
and crack, with frightful roar and clang; then out of holes and chasms
in the ground rush steam, gases&mdash;often foul and poisonous ones&mdash;hot
water, mud, flame, strange stones&mdash;all signs that the great boiler
down below has burst at last.</p>
<p>Then the strain is eased.&nbsp; The earth sinks together again, as
the ball did when it was pricked; and sinks lower, perhaps, than it
was before: and back rushes the sea, which the earth had thrust away
while it rose, and sweeps in, destroying all before it.</p>
<p>Of course, there is a great deal more to be said about all this:
but I have no time to tell you now.&nbsp; You will read it, I hope,
for yourselves when you grow up, in the writings of far wiser men than
I.&nbsp; Or perhaps you may feel for yourselves in foreign lands the
actual shock of a great earthquake, or see its work fresh done around
you.&nbsp; And if ever that happens, and you be preserved during the
danger, you will learn for yourself, I trust, more about earthquakes
than I can teach you, if you will only bear in mind the simple general
rules for understanding the &ldquo;how&rdquo; of them which I have given
you here.</p>
<p>But you do not seem satisfied yet?&nbsp; What is it that you want
to know?</p>
<p>Oh!&nbsp; There was an earthquake here in England the other night,
while you were asleep; and that seems to you too near to be pleasant.&nbsp;
Will there ever be earthquakes in England which will throw houses down,
and bury people in the ruins?</p>
<p>My dear child, I think you may set your heart at rest upon that point.&nbsp;
As far as the history of England goes back, and that is more than a
thousand years, there is no account of any earthquake which has done
any serious damage, or killed, I believe, a single human being.&nbsp;
The little earthquakes which are sometimes felt in England run generally
up one line of country, from Devonshire through Wales, and up the Severn
valley into Cheshire and Lancashire, and the south-west of Scotland;
and they are felt more smartly there, I believe, because the rocks are
harder there than here, and more tossed about by earthquakes which happened
ages and ages ago, long before man lived on the earth.&nbsp; I will
show you the work of these earthquakes some day, in the tilting and
twisting of the layers of rock, and in the cracks (faults, as they are
called) which run through them in different directions.&nbsp; I showed
you some once, if you recollect, in the chalk cliff at Ramsgate&mdash;two
set of cracks, sloping opposite ways, which I told you were made by
two separate sets of earthquakes, long, long ago, perhaps while the
chalk was still at the bottom of a deep sea.&nbsp; But even in the rocky
parts of England the earthquake-force seems to have all but died out.&nbsp;
Perhaps the crust of the earth has become too thick and solid there
to be much shaken by the gases and steam below.&nbsp; In this eastern
part of England, meanwhile, there is but little chance that an earthquake
will ever do much harm, because the ground here, for thousands of feet
down, is not hard and rocky, but soft&mdash;sands, clays, chalk, and
sands again; clays, soft limestones, and clays again&mdash;which all
act as buffers to deaden the earthquake shocks, and deaden too the earthquake
noise.</p>
<p>And how?</p>
<p>Put your ear to one end of a soft bolster, and let some one hit the
other end.&nbsp; You will hear hardly any noise, and will not feel the
blow at all.&nbsp; Put your ear to one end of a hard piece of wood,
and let some one hit the other.&nbsp; You will hear a smart tap; and
perhaps feel a smart tap, too.&nbsp; When you are older, and learn the
laws of sound, and of motion among the particles of bodies, you will
know why.&nbsp; Meanwhile you may comfort yourself with the thought
that Madam How has (doubtless by command of Lady Why) prepared a safe
soft bed for this good people of Britain&mdash;not that they may lie
and sleep on it, but work and till, plant and build and manufacture,
and thrive in peace and comfort, we will trust and pray, for many a
hundred years to come.&nbsp; All that the steam inside the earth is
likely to do to us, is to raise parts of this island (as Hartford Bridge
Flats were raised, ages ago, out of the old icy sea) so slowly, probably,
that no man can tell whether they are rising or not.&nbsp; Or again,
the steam-power may be even now dying out under our island, and letting
parts of it sink slowly into the sea, as some wise friends of mine think
that the fens in Norfolk and Cambridgeshire are sinking now.&nbsp; I
have shown you where that kind of work has gone on in Norfolk; how the
brow of Sandringham Hill was once a sea-cliff, and Dersingham Bog at
its foot a shallow sea; and therefore that the land has risen there.&nbsp;
How, again, at Hunstanton Station there is a beach of sea-shells twenty
feet above high-water mark, showing that the land has risen there likewise.&nbsp;
And how, farther north again, at Brancaster, there are forests of oak,
and fir, and alder, with their roots still in the soil, far below high-water
mark, and only uncovered at low tide; which is a plain sign that there
the land has sunk.&nbsp; You surely recollect the sunken forest at Brancaster,
and the beautiful shells we picked up in its gullies, and the millions
of live Pholases boring into the clay and peat which once was firm dry
land, fed over by giant oxen, and giant stags likewise, and perhaps
by the mammoth himself, the great woolly elephant whose teeth the fishermen
dredge up in the sea outside?&nbsp; You recollect that?&nbsp; Then remember
that as that Norfolk shore has changed, so slowly but surely is the
whole world changing around us.&nbsp; Hartford Bridge Flat here, for
instance, how has it changed!&nbsp; Ages ago it was the gravelly bottom
of a sea.&nbsp; Then the steam-power underground raised it up slowly,
through long ages, till it became dry land.&nbsp; And ages hence, perhaps,
it will have become a sea-bottom once more.&nbsp; Washed slowly by the
rain, or sunk by the dying out of the steam-power underground, it will
go down again to the place from whence it came.&nbsp; Seas will roll
where we stand now, and new lands will rise where seas now roll.&nbsp;
For all things on this earth, from the tiniest flower to the tallest
mountain, change and change all day long.&nbsp; Every atom of matter
moves perpetually; and nothing &ldquo;continues in one stay.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The solid-seeming earth on which you stand is but a heaving bubble,
bursting ever and anon in this place and in that.&nbsp; Only above all,
and through all, and with all, is One who does not move nor change,
but is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever.&nbsp; And on Him, my
child, and not on this bubble of an earth, do you and I, and all mankind,
depend.</p>
<p>But I have not yet told you why the Peruvians ought to have expected
an earthquake.&nbsp; True.&nbsp; I will tell you another time.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III&mdash;VOLCANOS</h2>
<p>You want to know why the Spaniards in Peru and Ecuador should have
expected an earthquake.</p>
<p>Because they had had so many already.&nbsp; The shaking of the ground
in their country had gone on perpetually, till they had almost ceased
to care about it, always hoping that no very heavy shock would come;
and being, now and then, terribly mistaken.</p>
<p>For instance, in the province of Quito, in the year 1797, from thirty
to forty thousand people were killed at once by an earthquake.&nbsp;
One would have thought that warning enough: but the warning was not
taken: and now, this very year, thousands more have been killed in the
very same country, in the very same way.</p>
<p>They might have expected as much.&nbsp; For their towns are built,
most of them, close to volcanos&mdash;some of the highest and most terrible
in the world.&nbsp; And wherever there are volcanos there will be earthquakes.&nbsp;
You may have earthquakes without volcanos, now and then; but volcanos
without earthquakes, seldom or never.</p>
<p>How does that come to pass?&nbsp; Does a volcano make earthquakes?&nbsp;
No; we may rather say that earthquakes are trying to make volcanos.&nbsp;
For volcanos are the holes which the steam underground has burst open
that it may escape into the air above.&nbsp; They are the chimneys of
the great blast-furnaces underground, in which Madam How pounds and
melts up the old rocks, to make them into new ones, and spread them
out over the land above.</p>
<p>And are there many volcanos in the world?&nbsp; You have heard of
Vesuvius, of course, in Italy; and Etna, in Sicily; and Hecla, in Iceland.&nbsp;
And you have heard, too, of Kilauea, in the Sandwich Islands, and of
Pele&rsquo;s Hair&mdash;the yellow threads of lava, like fine spun glass,
which are blown from off its pools of fire, and which the Sandwich Islanders
believed to be the hair of a goddess who lived in the crater;&mdash;and
you have read, too, I hope, in Miss Yonge&rsquo;s <i>Book of Golden
Deeds</i>, the noble story of the Christian chieftainess who, in order
to persuade her subjects to become Christians also, went down into the
crater and defied the goddess of the volcano, and came back unhurt and
triumphant.</p>
<p>But if you look at the map, you will see that there are many, many
more.&nbsp; Get Keith Johnston&rsquo;s Physical Atlas from the schoolroom&mdash;of
course it is there (for a schoolroom without a physical atlas is like
a needle without an eye)&mdash;and look at the map which is called &ldquo;Phenomena
of Volcanic Action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You will see in it many red dots, which mark the volcanos which are
still burning: and black dots, which mark those which have been burning
at some time or other, not very long ago, scattered about the world.&nbsp;
Sometimes they are single, like the red dot at Otaheite, or at Easter
Island in the Pacific.&nbsp; Sometimes the are in groups, or clusters,
like the cluster at the Sandwich Islands, or in the Friendly Islands,
or in New Zealand.&nbsp; And if we look in the Atlantic, we shall see
four clusters: one in poor half-destroyed Iceland, in the far north,
one in the Azores, one in the Canaries, and one in the Cape de Verds.&nbsp;
And there is one dot in those Canaries which we must not overlook, for
it is no other than the famous Peak of Teneriffe, a volcano which is
hardly burnt out yet, and may burn up again any day, standing up out
of the sea more than 12,000 feet high still, and once it must have been
double that height.&nbsp; Some think that it is perhaps the true Mount
Atlas, which the old Greeks named when first they ventured out of the
Straits of Gibraltar down the coast of Africa, and saw the great peak
far to the westward, with the clouds cutting off its top; and said that
it was a mighty giant, the brother of the Evening Star, who held up
the sky upon his shoulders, in the midst of the Fortunate Islands, the
gardens of the daughter of the Evening Star, full of strange golden
fruits; and that Perseus had turned him into stone, when he passed him
with the Gorgon&rsquo;s Head.</p>
<p>But you will see, too, that most of these red and black dots run
in crooked lines; and that many of the clusters run in lines likewise.</p>
<p>Look at one line: by far the largest on the earth.&nbsp; You will
learn a good deal of geography from it.</p>
<p>The red dots begin at a place called the Terribles, on the east side
of the Bay of Bengal.&nbsp; They run on, here and there, along the islands
of Sumatra and Java, and through the Spice Islands; and at New Guinea
the line of red dots forks.&nbsp; One branch runs south-east, through
islands whose names you never heard, to the Friendly Islands, and to
New Zealand.&nbsp; The other runs north, through the Philippines, through
Japan, through Kamschatka; and then there is a little break of sea,
between Asia and America: but beyond it, the red dots begin again in
the Aleutian Islands, and then turn down the whole west coast of America,
down from Mount Elias (in what was, till lately, Russian America) towards
British Columbia.&nbsp; Then, after a long gap, there are one or two
in Lower California (and we must not forget the terrible earthquake
which has just shaken San Francisco, between those two last places);
and when we come down to Mexico we find the red dots again plentiful,
and only too plentiful; for they mark the great volcanic line of Mexico,
of which you will read, I hope, some day, in Humboldt&rsquo;s works.&nbsp;
But the line does not stop there.&nbsp; After the little gap of the
Isthmus of Panama, it begins again in Quito, the very country which
has just been shaken, and in which stand the huge volcanos Chimborazo,
Pasto, Antisana, Cotopaxi, Pichincha, Tunguragua,&mdash;smooth cones
from 15,000 to 20,000 feet high, shining white with snow, till the heat
inside melts it off, and leaves the cinders of which the peaks are made
all black and ugly among the clouds, ready to burst in smoke and fire.&nbsp;
South of them again, there is a long gap, and then another line of red
dots&mdash;Arequiba, Chipicani, Gualatieri, Atacama,&mdash;as high as,
or higher than those in Quito; and this, remember, is the other country
which has just been shaken.&nbsp; On the sea-shore below those volcanos
stood the hapless city of Arica, whose ruins we saw in the picture.&nbsp;
Then comes another gap; and then a line of more volcanos in Chili, at
the foot of which happened that fearful earthquake of 1835 (besides
many more) of which you will read some day in that noble book <i>The
Voyage of the Beagle</i>; and so the line of dots runs down to the southernmost
point of America.</p>
<p>What a line we have traced!&nbsp; Long enough to go round the world
if it were straight.&nbsp; A line of holes out of which steam, and heat,
and cinders, and melted stones are rushing up, perpetually, in one place
and another.&nbsp; Now the holes in this line which are near each other
have certainly something to do with each other.&nbsp; For instance,
when the earth shook the other day round the volcanos of Quito, it shook
also round the volcanos of Peru, though they were 600 miles away.&nbsp;
And there are many stories of earthquakes being felt, or awful underground
thunder heard, while volcanos were breaking out hundreds of miles away.&nbsp;
I will give you a very curious instance of that.</p>
<p>If you look at the West Indies on the map, you will see a line of
red dots runs through the Windward Islands: there are two volcanos in
them, one in Guadaloupe, and one in St. Vincent (I will tell you a curious
story, presently, about that last), and little volcanos (if they have
ever been real volcanos at all), which now only send out mud, in Trinidad.&nbsp;
There the red dots stop: but then begins along the north coast of South
America a line of mountain country called Cumana, and Caraccas, which
has often been horribly shaken by earthquakes.&nbsp; Now once, when
the volcano in St. Vincent began to pour out a vast stream of melted
lava, a noise like thunder was heard underground, over thousands of
square miles beyond those mountains, in the plains of Calabozo, and
on the banks of the Apure, more than 600 miles away from the volcano,&mdash;a
plain sign that there was something underground which joined them together,
perhaps a long crack in the earth.&nbsp; Look for yourselves at the
places, and you will see that (as Humboldt says) it is as strange as
if an eruption of Mount Vesuvius was heard in the north of France.</p>
<p>So it seems as if these lines of volcanos stood along cracks in the
rind of the earth, through which the melted stuff inside was for ever
trying to force its way; and that, as the crack got stopped up in one
place by the melted stuff cooling and hardening again into stone, it
was burst in another place, and a fresh volcano made, or an old one
re-opened.</p>
<p>Now we can understand why earthquakes should be most common round
volcanos; and we can understand, too, why they would be worst before
a volcano breaks out, because then the steam is trying to escape; and
we can understand, too, why people who live near volcanos are glad to
see them blazing and spouting, because then they have hope that the
steam has found its way out, and will not make earthquakes any more
for a while.&nbsp; But still that is merely foolish speculation on chance.&nbsp;
Volcanos can never be trusted.&nbsp; No one knows when one will break
out, or what it will do; and those who live close to them&mdash;as the
city of Naples is close to Mount Vesuvius&mdash;must not be astonished
if they are blown up or swallowed up, as that great and beautiful city
of Naples may be without a warning, any day.</p>
<p>For what happened to that same Mount Vesuvius nearly 1800 years ago,
in the old Roman times?&nbsp; For ages and ages it had been lying quiet,
like any other hill.&nbsp; Beautiful cities were built at its foot,
filled with people who were as handsome, and as comfortable, and (I
am afraid) as wicked, as people ever were on earth.&nbsp; Fair gardens,
vineyards, olive-yards, covered the mountain slopes.&nbsp; It was held
to be one of the Paradises of the world.&nbsp; As for the mountain&rsquo;s
being a burning mountain, who ever thought of that?&nbsp; To be sure,
on the top of it was a great round crater, or cup, a mile or more across,
and a few hundred yards deep.&nbsp; But that was all overgrown with
bushes and wild vines, full of boars and deer.&nbsp; What sign of fire
was there in that?&nbsp; To be sure, also, there was an ugly place below
by the sea-shore, called the Phlegr&aelig;n fields, where smoke and
brimstone came out of the ground, and a lake called Avernus over which
poisonous gases hung, and which (old stories told) was one of the mouths
of the Nether Pit.&nbsp; But what of that?&nbsp; It had never harmed
any one, and how could it harm them?</p>
<p>So they all lived on, merrily and happily enough, till, in the year
A.D. 79 (that was eight years, you know, after the Emperor Titus destroyed
Jerusalem), there was stationed in the Bay of Naples a Roman admiral,
called Pliny, who was also a very studious and learned man, and author
of a famous old book on natural history.&nbsp; He was staying on shore
with his sister; and as he sat in his study she called him out to see
a strange cloud which had been hanging for some time over the top of
Mount Vesuvius.&nbsp; It was in shape just like a pine-tree; not, of
course, like one of our branching Scotch firs here, but like an Italian
stone pine, with a long straight stem and a flat parasol-shaped top.&nbsp;
Sometimes it was blackish, sometimes spotted; and the good Admiral Pliny,
who was always curious about natural science, ordered his cutter and
went away across the bay to see what it could be.&nbsp; Earthquake shocks
had been very common for the last few days; but I do not suppose that
Pliny had any notion that the earthquakes and the cloud had aught to
do with each other.&nbsp; However, he soon found out that they had,
and to his cost.&nbsp; When he got near the opposite shore some of the
sailors met him and entreated him to turn back.&nbsp; Cinders and pumice-stones
were falling down from the sky, and flames breaking out of the mountain
above.&nbsp; But Pliny would go on: he said that if people were in danger,
it was his duty to help them; and that he must see this strange cloud,
and note down the different shapes into which it changed.&nbsp; But
the hot ashes fell faster and faster; the sea ebbed out suddenly, and
left them nearly dry, and Pliny turned away to a place called Stabi&aelig;,
to the house of his friend Pomponianus, who was just going to escape
in a boat.&nbsp; Brave Pliny told him not to be afraid, ordered his
bath like a true Roman gentleman, and then went into dinner with a cheerful
face.&nbsp; Flames came down from the mountain, nearer and nearer as
the night drew on; but Pliny persuaded his friend that they were only
fires in some villages from which the peasants had fled, and then went
to bed and slept soundly.&nbsp; However, in the middle of the night
they found the courtyard being fast filled with cinders, and, if they
had not woke up the Admiral in time, he would never have been able to
get out of the house.&nbsp; The earthquake shocks grew stronger and
fiercer, till the house was ready to fall; and Pliny and his friend,
and the sailors and the slaves, all fled into the open fields, amid
a shower of stones and cinders, tying pillows over their heads to prevent
their being beaten down.&nbsp; The day had come by this time, but not
the dawn&mdash;for it was still pitch dark as night.&nbsp; They went
down to their boats upon the shore; but the sea raged so horribly that
there was no getting on board of them.&nbsp; Then Pliny grew tired,
and made his men spread a sail for him, and lay down on it; but there
came down upon them a rush of flames, and a horrible smell of sulphur,
and all ran for their lives.&nbsp; Some of the slaves tried to help
the Admiral upon his legs; but he sank down again overpowered with the
brimstone fumes, and so was left behind.&nbsp; When they came back again,
there he lay dead, but with his clothes in order and his face as quiet
as if he had been only sleeping.&nbsp; And that was the end of a brave
and learned man&mdash;a martyr to duty and to the love of science.</p>
<p>But what was going on in the meantime?&nbsp; Under clouds of ashes,
cinders, mud, lava, three of those happy cities were buried at once&mdash;Herculaneum,
Pompeii, Stabi&aelig;.&nbsp; They were buried just as the people had
fled from them, leaving the furniture and the earthenware, often even
jewels and gold, behind, and here and there among them a human being
who had not had time to escape from the dreadful deluge of dust.&nbsp;
The ruins of Herculaneum and Pompeii have been dug into since; and the
paintings, especially in Pompeii, are found upon the walls still fresh,
preserved from the air by the ashes which have covered them in.&nbsp;
When you are older you perhaps will go to Naples, and see in its famous
museum the curiosities which have been dug out of the ruined cities;
and you will walk, I suppose, along the streets of Pompeii and see the
wheel-tracks in the pavement, along which carts and chariots rumbled
2000 years ago.&nbsp; Meanwhile, if you go nearer home, to the Crystal
Palace and to the Pompeian Court, as it is called, you will see an exact
model of one of these old buried houses, copied even to the very paintings
on the wells, and judge for yourself, as far as a little boy can judge,
what sort of life these thoughtless, luckless people lived 2000 years
ago.</p>
<p>And what had become of Vesuvius, the treacherous mountain?&nbsp;
Half or more than half of the side of the old crater had been blown
away, and what was left, which is now called the Monte Somma, stands
in a half circle round the new cone and new crater which is burning
at this very day.&nbsp; True, after that eruption which killed Pliny,
Vesuvius fell asleep again, and did not awake for 134 years, and then
again for 269 years but it has been growing more and more restless as
the ages have passed on, and now hardly a year passes without its sending
out smoke and stones from its crater, and streams of lava from its sides.</p>
<p>And now, I suppose, you will want to know what a volcano is like,
and what a cone, and a crater, and lava are?</p>
<p>What a volcano is like, it is easy enough to show you; for they are
the most simply and beautifully shaped of all mountains, and they are
alike all over the world, whether they be large or small.&nbsp; Almost
every volcano in the world, I believe, is, or has been once, of the
shape which you see in the drawing opposite; even those volcanos in
the Sandwich Islands, of which you have often heard, which are now great
lakes of boiling fire upon flat downs, without any cone to them at all.&nbsp;
They, I believe, are volcanos which have fallen in ages ago: just as
in Java a whole burning mountain fell in on the night of the 11th of
August, in the year 1772.&nbsp; Then, after a short and terrible earthquake,
a bright cloud suddenly covered the whole mountain.&nbsp; The people
who dwelt around it tried to escape; but before the poor souls could
get away the earth sunk beneath their feet, and the whole mountain fell
in and was swallowed up with a noise as if great cannon were being fired.&nbsp;
Forty villages and nearly 3000 people were destroyed, and where the
mountain had been was only a plain of red-hot stones.&nbsp; In the same
way, in the year 1698, the top of a mountain in Quito fell in in a single
night, leaving only two immense peaks of rock behind, and pouring out
great floods of mud mixed with dead fish; for there are underground
lakes among those volcanos which swarm with little fish which never
see the light.</p>
<p>But most volcanos as I say, are, or have been, the shape of the one
which you see here.&nbsp; This is Cotopaxi, in Quito, more than 19,000
feet in height.&nbsp; All those sloping sides are made of cinders and
ashes, braced together, I suppose, by bars of solid lava-stone inside,
which prevent the whole from crumbling down.&nbsp; The upper part, you
see, is white with snow, as far down as a line which is 15,000 feet
above the sea; for the mountain is in the tropics, close to the equator,
and the snow will not lie in that hot climate any lower down.&nbsp;
But now and then the snow melts off and rushes down the mountain side
in floods of water and of mud, and the cindery cone of Cotopaxi stands
out black and dreadful against the clear blue sky, and then the people
of that country know what is coming.&nbsp; The mountain is growing so
hot inside that it melts off its snowy covering; and soon it will burst
forth with smoke and steam, and red-hot stones and earthquakes, which
will shake the ground, and roars that will be heard, it may be, hundreds
of miles away.</p>
<p>And now for the words cone, crater, lava.&nbsp; If I can make you
understand those words, you will see why volcanos must be in general
of the shape of Cotopaxi.</p>
<p>Cone, crater, lava: those words make up the alphabet of volcano learning.&nbsp;
The cone is the outside of a huge chimney; the crater is the mouth of
it.&nbsp; The lava is the ore which is being melted in the furnace below,
that it may flow out over the surface of the old land, and make new
land instead.</p>
<p>And where is the furnace itself?&nbsp; Who can tell that?&nbsp; Under
the roots of the mountains, under the depths of the sea; down &ldquo;the
path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture&rsquo;s eye hath not
seen: the lion&rsquo;s whelp hath not trodden it, nor the fierce lion
passed by it.&nbsp; There He putteth forth His hand upon the rock; He
overturneth the mountain by the roots; He cutteth out rivers among the
rocks; and His eye seeth every precious thing&rdquo;&mdash;while we,
like little ants, run up and down outside the earth, scratching, like
ants, a few feet down, and calling that a deep ravine; or peeping a
few feet down into the crater of a volcano, unable to guess what precious
things may lie below&mdash;below even the fire which blazes and roars
up through the thin crust of the earth.&nbsp; For of the inside of this
earth we know nothing whatsoever: we only know that it is, on an average,
several times as heavy as solid rock; but how that can be, we know not.</p>
<p>So let us look at the chimney, and what comes out of it; for we can
see very little more.</p>
<p>Why is a volcano like a cone?</p>
<p>For the same cause for which a molehill is like a cone, though a
very rough one; and that the little heaps which the burrowing beetles
make on the moor, or which the ant-lions in France make in the sand,
are all something in the shape of a cone, with a hole like a crater
in the middle.&nbsp; What the beetle and the ant-lion do on a very little
scale, the steam inside the earth does on a great scale.&nbsp; When
once it has forced a vent into the outside air, it tears out the rocks
underground, grinds them small against each other, often into the finest
dust, and blasts them out of the hole which it has made.&nbsp; Some
of them fall back into the hole, and are shot out again: but most of
them fall round the hole, most of them close to it, and fewer of them
farther off, till they are piled up in a ring round it, just as the
sand is piled up round a beetle&rsquo;s burrow.&nbsp; For days, and
weeks, and months this goes on; even it may be for hundreds of years:
till a great cone is formed round the steam vent, hundreds or thousands
of feet in height, of dust and stones, and of cinders likewise.&nbsp;
For recollect, that when the steam has blown away the cold earth and
rock near the surface of the ground, it begins blowing out the hot rocks
down below, red-hot, white-hot, and at last actually melted.&nbsp; But
these, as they are hurled into the cool air above, become ashes, cinders,
and blocks of stone again, making the hill on which they fall bigger
and bigger continually.&nbsp; And thus does wise Madam How stand in
no need of bricklayers, but makes her chimneys build themselves.</p>
<p>And why is the mouth of the chimney called a crater?</p>
<p>Crater, as you know, is Greek for a cup.&nbsp; And the mouth of these
chimneys, when they have become choked and stopped working, are often
just the shape of a cup, or (as the Germans call them) kessels, which
means kettles, or caldrons.&nbsp; I have seen some of them as beautifully
and exactly rounded as if a cunning engineer had planned them, and had
them dug out with the spade.&nbsp; At first, of course, their sides
and bottom are nothing but loose stones, cinders, slag, ashes, such
as would be thrown out of a furnace.&nbsp; But Madam How, who, whenever
she makes an ugly desolate place, always tries to cover over its ugliness,
and set something green to grow over it, and make it pretty once more,
does so often and often by her worn-out craters.&nbsp; I have seen them
covered with short sweet turf, like so many chalk downs.&nbsp; I have
seen them, too, filled with bushes, which held woodcocks and wild boars.&nbsp;
Once I came on a beautiful round crater on the top of a mountain, which
was filled at the bottom with a splendid crop of potatoes.&nbsp; Though
Madam How had not put them there herself, she had at least taught the
honest Germans to put them there.&nbsp; And often Madam How turns her
worn-out craters into beautiful lakes.&nbsp; There are many such crater-lakes
in Italy, as you will see if ever you go there; as you may see in English
galleries painted by Wilson, a famous artist who died before you were
born.&nbsp; You recollect Lord Macaulay&rsquo;s ballad, &ldquo;The Battle
of the Lake Regillus&rdquo;?&nbsp; Then that Lake Regillus (if I recollect
right) is one of these round crater lakes.&nbsp; Many such deep clear
blue lakes have I seen in the Eifel, in Germany; and many a curious
plant have I picked on their shores, where once the steam blasted, and
the earthquake roared, and the ash-clouds rushed up high into the heaven,
and buried all the land around in dust, which is now fertile soil.&nbsp;
And long did I puzzle to find out why the water stood in some craters,
while others, within a mile of them perhaps, were perfectly dry.&nbsp;
That I never found out for myself.&nbsp; But learned men tell me that
the ashes which fall back into the crater, if the bottom of it be wet
from rain, will sometimes &ldquo;set&rdquo; (as it is called) into a
hard cement; and so make the bottom of the great bowl waterproof, as
if it were made of earthenware.</p>
<p>But what gives the craters this cup-shape at first?</p>
<p>Think&mdash;While the steam and stones are being blown out, the crater
is an open funnel, with more or less upright walls inside.&nbsp; As
the steam grows weaker, fewer and fewer stones fall outside, and more
and more fall back again inside.&nbsp; At last they quite choke up the
bottom of the great round hole.&nbsp; Perhaps, too, the lava or melted
rock underneath cools and grows hard, and that chokes up the hole lower
down.&nbsp; Then, down from the round edge of the crater the stones
and cinders roll inward more and more.&nbsp; The rains wash them down,
the wind blows them down.&nbsp; They roll to the middle, and meet each
other, and stop.&nbsp; And so gradually the steep funnel becomes a round
cup.&nbsp; You may prove for yourself that it must be so, if you will
try.&nbsp; Do you not know that if you dig a round hole in the ground,
and leave it to crumble in, it is sure to become cup-shaped at last,
though at first its sides may have been quite upright, like those of
a bucket?&nbsp; If you do not know, get a trowel and make your little
experiment.</p>
<p>And now you ought to understand what &ldquo;cone&rdquo; and &ldquo;crater&rdquo;
mean.&nbsp; And more, if you will think for yourself, you may guess
what would come out of a volcano when it broke out &ldquo;in an eruption,&rdquo;
as it is usually called.&nbsp; First, clouds of steam and dust (what
you would call smoke); then volleys of stones, some cool, some burning
hot; and at the last, because it lies lowest of all, the melted rock
itself, which is called lava.</p>
<p>And where would that come out?&nbsp; At the top of the chimney?&nbsp;
At the top of the cone?</p>
<p>No.&nbsp; Madam How, as I told you, usually makes things make themselves.&nbsp;
She has made the chimney of the furnace make itself; and next she will
make the furnace-door make itself.</p>
<p>The melted lava rises in the crater&mdash;the funnel inside the cone&mdash;but
it never gets to the top.&nbsp; It is so enormously heavy that the sides
of the cone cannot bear its weight, and give way low down.&nbsp; And
then, through ashes and cinders, the melted lava burrows out, twisting
and twirling like an enormous fiery earth-worm, till it gets to the
air outside, and runs off down the mountain in a stream of fire.&nbsp;
And so you may see (as are to be seen on Vesuvius now) two eruptions
at once&mdash;one of burning stones above, and one of melted lava below.</p>
<p>And what is lava?</p>
<p>That, I think, I must tell you another time.&nbsp; For when I speak
of it I shall have to tell you more about Madam How, and her ways of
making the ground on which you stand, than I can say just now.&nbsp;
But if you want to know (as I dare say you do) what the eruption of
a volcano is like, you may read what follows.&nbsp; I did not see it
happen; for I never had the good fortune of seeing a mountain burning,
though I have seen many and many a one which has been burnt&mdash;extinct
volcanos, as they are called.</p>
<p>The man who saw it&mdash;a very good friend of mine, and a very good
man of science also&mdash;went last year to see an eruption on Vesuvius,
not from the main crater, but from a small one which had risen up suddenly
on the outside of it; and he gave me leave (when I told him that I was
writing for children) to tell them what he saw.</p>
<p>This new cone, he said, was about 200 feet high, and perhaps 80 or
100 feet across at the top.&nbsp; And as he stood below it (it was not
safe to go up it) smoke rolled up from its top, &ldquo;rosy pink below,&rdquo;
from the glare of the caldron, and above &ldquo;faint greenish or blueish
silver of indescribable beauty, from the light of the moon.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But more&mdash;By good chance, the cone began to send out, not smoke
only, but brilliant burning stones.&nbsp; &ldquo;Each explosion,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;was like a vast girandole of rockets, with a noise (such
as rockets would make) like the waves on a beach, or the wind blowing
through shrouds.&nbsp; The mountain was trembling the whole time.&nbsp;
So it went on for two hours and more; sometimes eight or ten explosions
in a minute, and more than 1000 stones in each, some as large as two
bricks end to end.&nbsp; The largest ones mostly fell back into the
crater; but the smaller ones being thrown higher, and more acted on
by the wind, fell in immense numbers on the leeward slope of the cone&rdquo;
(of course, making it bigger and bigger, as I have explained already
to you), and of course, as they were intensely hot and bright, making
the cone look as if it too was red-hot.&nbsp; But it was not so, he
says, really.&nbsp; The colour of the stones was rather &ldquo;golden,
and they spotted the black cone over with their golden showers, the
smaller ones stopping still, the bigger ones rolling down, and jumping
along just like hares.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A wonderful pedestal,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;for the explosion which surmounted it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
How high the stones flew up he could not tell.&nbsp; &ldquo;There was
generally one which went much higher than the rest, and pierced upwards
towards the moon, who looked calmly down, mocking such vain attempts
to reach her.&rdquo;&nbsp; The large stones, of course, did not rise
so high; and some, he says, &ldquo;only just appeared over the rim of
the cone, above which they came floating leisurely up, to show their
brilliant forms and intense white light for an instant, and then subside
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Try and picture that to yourselves, remembering that this was only
a little side eruption, of no more importance to the whole mountain
than the fall of a slate off the roof is of importance to the whole
house.&nbsp; And then think how mean and weak man&rsquo;s fireworks,
and even man&rsquo;s heaviest artillery, are compared with the terrible
beauty and terrible strength of Madam How&rsquo;s artillery underneath
our feet.</p>

<p>Now look at this figure.&nbsp; It represents a section of a volcano;
that is, one cut in half to show you the inside.&nbsp; A is the cone
of cinders.&nbsp; B, the black line up through the middle, is the funnel,
or crack, through which steam, ashes, lava, and everything else rises.&nbsp;
C is the crater mouth.&nbsp; D D D, which looks broken, are the old
rocks which the steam heaved up and burst before it could get out.&nbsp;
And what are the black lines across, marked E E E?&nbsp; They are the
streams of lava which have burrowed out, some covered up again in cinders,
some lying bare in the open air, some still inside the cone, bracing
it together, holding it up.&nbsp; Something like this is the inside
of a volcano.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV&mdash;THE TRANSFORMATIONS OF A GRAIN OF SOIL</h2>
<p>Why, you ask, are there such terrible things as volcanos?&nbsp; Of
what use can they be?</p>
<p>They are of use enough, my child; and of many more uses, doubt not,
than we know as yet, or ever shall know.&nbsp; But of one of their uses
I can tell you.</p>
<p>They make, or help to make, divers and sundry curious things, from
gunpowder to your body and mine.</p>
<p>What?&nbsp; I can understand their helping to make gunpowder, because
the sulphur in it is often found round volcanos; and I know the story
of the brave Spaniard who, when his fellows wanted materials for gunpowder,
had himself lowered in a basket down the crater of a South American
volcano, and gathered sulphur for them off the burning cliffs: but how
can volcanos help to make me?&nbsp; Am I made of lava?&nbsp; Or is there
lava in me?</p>
<p>My child, I did not say that volcanos helped to make you.&nbsp; I
said that they helped to make your body; which is a very different matter,
as I beg you to remember, now and always.&nbsp; Your body is no more
you yourself than the hoop which you trundle, or the pony which you
ride.&nbsp; It is, like them, your servant, your tool, your instrument,
your organ, with which you work: and a very useful, trusty, cunningly-contrived
organ it is; and therefore I advise you to make good use of it, for
you are responsible for it.&nbsp; But you yourself are not your body,
or your brain, but something else, which we call your soul, your spirit,
your life.&nbsp; And that &ldquo;you yourself&rdquo; would remain just
the same if it were taken out of your body, and put into the body of
a bee, or of a lion, or any other body; or into no body at all.&nbsp;
At least so I believe; and so, I am happy to say, nine hundred and ninety-nine
thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine people out of every million have
always believed, because they have used their human instincts and their
common sense, and have obeyed (without knowing it) the warning of a
great and good philosopher called Herder, that &ldquo;The organ is in
no case the power which works by it;&rdquo; which is as much as to say,
that the engine is not the engine-driver, nor the spade the gardener.</p>
<p>There have always been, and always will be, a few people who cannot
see that.&nbsp; They think that a man&rsquo;s soul is part of his body,
and that he himself is not one thing, but a great number of things.&nbsp;
They think that his mind and character are only made up of all the thoughts,
and feelings, and recollections which have passed through his brain;
and that as his brain changes, he himself must change, and become another
person, and then another person again, continually.&nbsp; But do you
not agree with them: but keep in mind wise Herder&rsquo;s warning that
you are not to &ldquo;confound the organ with the power,&rdquo; or the
engine with the driver, or your body with yourself: and then we will
go on and consider how a volcano, and the lava which flows from it,
helps to make your body.</p>
<p>Now I know that the Scotch have a saying, &ldquo;That you cannot
make broth out of whinstones&rdquo; (which is their name for lava).&nbsp;
But, though they are very clever people, they are wrong there.&nbsp;
I never saw any broth in Scotland, as far as I know, but what whinstones
had gone to the making of it; nor a Scotch boy who had not eaten many
a bit of whinstone, and been all the better for it.</p>
<p>Of course, if you simply put the whinstones into a kettle and boiled
them, you would not get much out of them by such rough cookery as that.&nbsp;
But Madam How is the best and most delicate of all cooks; and she knows
how to pound, and soak, and stew whinstones so delicately, that she
can make them sauce and seasoning for meat, vegetables, puddings, and
almost everything that you eat; and can put into your veins things which
were spouted up red-hot by volcanos, ages and ages since, perhaps at
the bottom of ancient seas which are now firm dry land.</p>
<p>This is very strange&mdash;as all Madam How&rsquo;s doings are.&nbsp;
And you would think it stranger still if you had ever seen the flowing
of a lava stream.</p>
<p>Out of a cave of slag and cinders in the black hillside rushes a
golden river, flowing like honey, and yet so tough that you cannot thrust
a stick into it, and so heavy that great stones (if you throw them on
it) float on the top, and are carried down like corks on water.&nbsp;
It is so hot that you cannot stand near it more than a few seconds;
hotter, perhaps, than any fire you ever saw: but as it flows, the outside
of it cools in the cool air, and gets covered with slag and cinders,
something like those which you may see thrown out of the furnaces in
the Black Country of Staffordshire.&nbsp; Sometimes these cling together
above the lava stream, and make a tunnel, through the cracks in which
you may see the fiery river rushing and roaring down below.&nbsp; But
mostly they are kept broken and apart, and roll and slide over each
other on the top of the lava, crashing and clanging as they grind together
with a horrid noise.&nbsp; Of course that stream, like all streams,
runs towards the lower grounds.&nbsp; It slides down glens, and fills
them up; down the beds of streams, driving off the water in hissing
steam; and sometimes (as it did in Iceland a few years ago) falls over
some cliff, turning what had been a water-fall into a fire-fall, and
filling up the pool below with blocks of lava suddenly cooled, with
a clang and roar like that of chains shaken or brazen vessels beaten,
which is heard miles and miles away.&nbsp; Of course, woe to the crops
and gardens which stand in its way.&nbsp; It crawls over them all and
eats them up.&nbsp; It shoves down houses; it sets woods on fire, and
sends the steam and gas out of the tree-trunks hissing into the air.&nbsp;
And (curiously enough) it does this often without touching the trees
themselves.&nbsp; It flows round the trunks (it did so in a wood in
the Sandwich Islands a few years ago), and of course sets them on fire
by its heat, till nothing is left of them but blackened posts.&nbsp;
But the moisture which comes out of the poor tree in steam blows so
hard against the lava round that it can never touch the tree, and a
round hole is left in the middle of the lava where the tree was.&nbsp;
Sometimes, too, the lava will spit out liquid fire among the branches
of the trees, which hangs down afterwards from them in tassels of slag,
and yet, by the very same means, the steam in the branches will prevent
the liquid fire burning them off, or doing anything but just scorch
the bark.</p>
<p>But I can tell you a more curious story still.&nbsp; The lava stream,
you must know, is continually sending out little jets of gas and steam:
some of it it may have brought up from the very inside of the earth;
most of it, I suspect, comes from the damp herbage and damp soil over
which it runs.&nbsp; Be that as it may, a lava stream out of Mount Etna,
in Sicily, came once down straight upon the town of Catania.&nbsp; Everybody
thought that the town would be swallowed up; and the poor people there
(who knew no better) began to pray to St. Agatha&mdash;a famous saint,
who, they say, was martyred there ages ago&mdash;and who, they fancy,
has power in heaven to save them from the lava stream.&nbsp; And really
what happened was enough to make ignorant people, such as they were,
think that St. Agatha had saved them.&nbsp; The lava stream came straight
down upon the town wall.&nbsp; Another foot, and it would have touched
it, and have begun shoving it down with a force compared with which
all the battering-rams that you ever read of in ancient histories would
be child&rsquo;s toys.&nbsp; But lo and behold! when the lava stream
got within a few inches of the wall it stopped, and began to rear itself
upright and build itself into a wall beside the wall.&nbsp; It rose
and rose, till I believe in one place it overtopped the wall and began
to curl over in a crest.&nbsp; All expected that it would fall over
into the town at last: but no, there it stopped, and cooled, and hardened,
and left the town unhurt.&nbsp; All the inhabitants said, of course,
that St. Agatha had done it: but learned men found out that, as usual
Madam How had done it, by making it do itself.&nbsp; The lava was so
full of gas, which was continually blowing out in little jets, that
when it reached the wall, it actually blew itself back from the wall;
and, as the wall was luckily strong enough not to be blown down, the
lava kept blowing itself back till it had time to cool.&nbsp; And so,
my dear child, there was no miracle at all in the matter; and the poor
people of Catania had to thank not St. Agatha, and any interference
of hers, but simply Him who can preserve, just as He can destroy, by
those laws of nature which are the breath of His mouth and the servants
of His will.</p>
<p>But in many a case the lava does not stop.&nbsp; It rolls on and
on over the downs and through the valleys, till it reaches the sea-shore,
as it did in Hawaii in the Sandwich Islands this very year.&nbsp; And
then it cools, of course; but often not before it has killed the fish
by its sulphurous gases and heat, perhaps for miles around.&nbsp; And
there is good reason to believe that the fossil fish which we so often
find in rocks, perfect in every bone, lying sometimes in heaps, and
twisted (as I have seen them) as if they had died suddenly and violently,
were killed in this very way, either by heat from lava streams, or else
by the bursting up of gases poisoning the water, in earthquakes and
eruptions in the bottom of the sea.&nbsp; I could tell you many stories
of fish being killed in thousands by earthquakes and volcanos during
the last few years.&nbsp; But we have not time to tell about everything.</p>
<p>And now you will ask me, with more astonishment than ever, what possible
use can there be in these destroying streams of fire?&nbsp; And certainly,
if you had ever seen a lava stream even when cool, and looked down,
as I have done, at the great river of rough black blocks streaming away
far and wide over the land, you would think it the most hideous and
the most useless thing you ever saw.&nbsp; And yet, my dear child, there
is One who told men to judge not according to the appearance, but to
judge righteous judgment.&nbsp; He said that about matters spiritual
and human: but it is quite as true about matters natural, which also
are His work, and all obey His will.</p>
<p>Now if you had seen, as I have seen, close round the edges of these
lava streams, and sometimes actually upon them, or upon the great bed
of dust and ashes which have been hurled far and wide out of ancient
volcanos, happy homesteads, rich crops, hemp and flax, and wheat, tobacco,
lucerne, roots, and vineyards laden with white and purple grapes, you
would have begun to suspect that the lava streams were not, after all,
such very bad neighbours.&nbsp; And when I tell you that volcanic soils
(as they are called), that is, soil which has at first been lava or
ashes, are generally the richest soils in the world&mdash;that, for
instance (as some one told me the other day), there is soil in the beautiful
island of Madeira so thin that you cannot dig more than two or three
inches down without coming to the solid rock of lava, or what is harder
even, obsidian (which is the black glass which volcanos sometimes make,
and which the old Mexicans used to chip into swords and arrows, because
they had no steel)&mdash;and that this soil, thin as it is, is yet so
fertile, that in it used to be grown the grapes of which the famous
Madeira wine was made&mdash;when you remember this, and when you remember,
too, the Lothians of Scotland (about which I shall have to say a little
to you just now), then you will perhaps agree with me, that Lady Why
has not been so very wrong in setting Madam How to pour out lava and
ashes upon the surface of the earth.</p>
<p>For see&mdash;down below, under the roots of the mountains, Madam
How works continually like a chemist in his laboratory, melting together
all the rocks, which are the bones and leavings of the old worlds.&nbsp;
If they stayed down below there, they would be of no use; while they
will be of use up here in the open air.&nbsp; For, year by year&mdash;by
the washing of rain and rivers, and also, I am sorry to say, by the
ignorant and foolish waste of mankind&mdash;thousands and millions of
tons of good stuff are running into the sea every year, which would,
if it could be kept on land, make food for men and animals, plants and
trees.&nbsp; So, in order to supply the continual waste of this upper
world, Madam How is continually melting up the under world, and pouring
it out of the volcanos like manure, to renew the face of the earth.&nbsp;
In these lava rocks and ashes which she sends up there are certain substances,
without which men cannot live&mdash;without which a stalk of corn or
grass cannot grow.&nbsp; Without potash, without magnesia, both of which
are in your veins and mine&mdash;without silicates (as they are called),
which give flint to the stems of corn and of grass, and so make them
stiff and hard, and able to stand upright&mdash;and very probably without
the carbonic acid gas, which comes out of the volcanos, and is taken
up by the leaves of plants, and turned by Madam How&rsquo;s cookery
into solid wood&mdash;without all these things, and I suspect without
a great many more things which come out of volcanos&mdash;I do not see
how this beautiful green world could get on at all.</p>
<p>Of course, when the lava first cools on the surface of the ground
it is hard enough, and therefore barren enough.&nbsp; But Madam How
sets to work upon it at once, with that delicate little water-spade
of hers, which we call rain, and with that alone, century after century,
and age after age, she digs the lava stream down, atom by atom, and
silts it over the country round in rich manure.&nbsp; So that if Madam
How has been a rough and hasty workwoman in pumping her treasures up
out of her mine with her great steam-pumps, she shows herself delicate
and tender and kindly enough in giving them away afterwards.</p>
<p>Nay, even the fine dust which is sometimes blown out of volcanos
is useful to countries far away.&nbsp; So light it is, that it rises
into the sky and is wafted by the wind across the seas.&nbsp; So, in
the year 1783, ashes from the Skaptar Jokull, in Iceland, were carried
over the north of Scotland, and even into Holland, hundreds of miles
to the south.</p>
<p>So, again, when in the year 1812 the volcano of St. Vincent, in the
West India Islands, poured out torrents of lava, after mighty earthquakes
which shook all that part of the world, a strange thing happened (about
which I have often heard from those who saw it) in the island of Barbados,
several hundred miles away.&nbsp; For when the sun rose in the morning
(it was a Sunday morning), the sky remained more dark than any night,
and all the poor negroes crowded terrified out of their houses into
the streets, fancying the end of the world was come.&nbsp; But a learned
man who was there, finding that, though the sun was risen, it was still
pitchy dark, opened his window, and found that it was stuck fast by
something on the ledge outside, and, when he thrust it open, found the
ledge covered deep in soft red dust; and he instantly said, like a wise
man as he was, &ldquo;The volcano of St. Vincent must have broken out,
and these are the ashes from it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he ran down stairs
and quieted the poor negroes, telling them not to be afraid, for the
end of the world was not coming just yet.&nbsp; But still the dust went
on falling till the whole island, I am told, was covered an inch thick;
and the same thing happened in the other islands round.&nbsp; People
thought&mdash;and they had reason to think from what had often happened
elsewhere&mdash;that though the dust might hurt the crops for that year,
it would make them richer in years to come, because it would act as
manure upon the soil; and so it did after a few years; but it did terrible
damage at the time, breaking off the boughs of trees and covering up
the crops; and in St. Vincent itself whole estates were ruined.&nbsp;
It was a frightful day, but I know well that behind that How there was
a Why for its happening, and happening too, about that very time, which
all who know the history of negro slavery in the West Indies can guess
for themselves, and confess, I hope, that in this case, as in all others,
when Lady Why seems most severe she is often most just and kind.</p>
<p>Ah! my dear child, that I could go on talking to you of this for
hours and days!&nbsp; But I have time now only to teach you the alphabet
of these matters&mdash;and, indeed, I know little more than the alphabet
myself; but if the very letters of Madam How&rsquo;s book, and the mere
A, B, AB, of it, which I am trying to teach you, are so wonderful and
so beautiful, what must its sentences be and its chapters?&nbsp; And
what must the whole book be like?&nbsp; But that last none can read
save He who wrote it before the worlds were made.</p>
<p>But now I see you want to ask a question.&nbsp; Let us have it out.&nbsp;
I would sooner answer one question of yours than tell you ten things
without your asking.</p>
<p>Is there potash and magnesia and silicates in the soil here?&nbsp;
And if there is, where did they come from?&nbsp; For there are no volcanos
in England.</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; There are such things in the soil; and little enough of
them, as the farmers here know too well.&nbsp; For we here, in Windsor
Forest, are on the very poorest and almost the newest soil in England;
and when Madam How had used up all her good materials in making the
rest of the island, she carted away her dry rubbish and shot it down
here for us to make the best of; and I do not think that we and our
forefathers have done so very ill with it.&nbsp; But where the rich
part, or staple, of our soils came from first it would be very difficult
to say, so often has Madam How made, and unmade, and re-made England,
and sifted her materials afresh every time.&nbsp; But if you go to the
Lowlands of Scotland, you may soon see where the staple of the soil
came from there, and that I was right in saying that there were atoms
of lava in every Scotch boy&rsquo;s broth.&nbsp; Not that there were
ever (as far as I know) volcanos in Scotland or in England.&nbsp; Madam
How has more than one string to her bow, or two strings either; so when
she pours out her lavas, she does not always pour them out in the open
air.&nbsp; Sometimes she pours them out at the bottom of the sea, as
she did in the north of Ireland and the south-west of Scotland, when
she made the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway, and Fingal&rsquo;s Cave in Staffa
too, at the bottom of the old chalk ocean, ages and ages since.&nbsp;
Sometimes she squirts them out between the layers of rock, or into cracks
which the earthquakes have made, in what are called trap dykes, of which
there are plenty to be seen in Scotland, and in Wales likewise.&nbsp;
And then she lifts the earth up from the bottom of the sea, and sets
the rain to wash away all the soft rocks, till the hard lava stands
out in great hills upon the surface of the ground.&nbsp; Then the rain
begins eating away those lava-hills likewise, and manuring the earth
with them; and wherever those lava-hills stand up, whether great or
small, there is pretty sure to be rich land around them.&nbsp; If you
look at the Geological Map of England and Ireland, and the red spots
upon it, which will show you where those old lavas are, you will see
how much of them there is in England, at the Lizard Point in Cornwall,
and how much more in Scotland and the north of Ireland.&nbsp; In South
Devon, in Shropshire&mdash;with its beautiful Wrekin, and Caradoc, and
Lawley&mdash;in Wales, round Snowdon (where some of the soil is very
rich), and, above all, in the Lowlands of Scotland, you see these red
marks, showing the old lavas, which are always fertile, except the poor
old granite, which is of little use save to cut into building stone,
because it is too full of quartz&mdash;that is, flint.</p>
<p>Think of this the next time you go through Scotland in the railway,
especially when you get near Edinburgh.&nbsp; As you run through the
Lothians, with their noble crops of corn, and roots, and grasses&mdash;and
their great homesteads, each with its engine chimney, which makes steam
do the work of men&mdash;you will see rising out of the plain, hills
of dark rock, sometimes in single knobs, like Berwick Law or Stirling
Crag&mdash;sometimes in noble ranges, like Arthur&rsquo;s Seat, or the
Sidlaws, or the Ochils.&nbsp; Think what these black bare lumps of whinstone
are, and what they do.&nbsp; Remember they are mines&mdash;not gold
mines, but something richer still&mdash;food mines, which Madam How
thrust into the inside of the earth, ages and ages since, as molten
lava rock, and then cooled them and lifted them up, and pared them away
with her ice-plough and her rain-spade, and spread the stuff of them
over the wide carses round, to make in that bleak northern climate,
which once carried nothing but fir-trees and heather, a soil fit to
feed a great people; to cultivate in them industry, and science, and
valiant self-dependence and self-help; and to gather round the Heart
of Midlothian and the Castle Rock of Edinburgh the stoutest and the
ablest little nation which Lady Why has made since she made the Greeks
who fought at Salamis.</p>
<p>Of those Greeks you have read, or ought to read, in Mr. Cox&rsquo;s
<i>Tales of the Persian War</i>.&nbsp; Some day you will read of them
in their own books, written in their grand old tongue.&nbsp; Remember
that Lady Why made them, as she has made the Scotch, by first preparing
a country for them, which would call out all their courage and their
skill; and then by giving them the courage and the skill to make use
of the land where she had put them.</p>
<p>And now think what a wonderful fairy tale you might write for yourself&mdash;and
every word of it true&mdash;of the adventures of one atom of Potash
or some other Salt, no bigger than a needle&rsquo;s point, in such a
lava stream as I have been telling of.&nbsp; How it has run round and
round, and will run round age after age, in an endless chain of change.&nbsp;
How it began by being molten fire underground, how then it became part
of a hard cold rock, lifted up into a cliff, beaten upon by rain and
storm, and washed down into the soil of the plain, till, perhaps, the
little atom of mineral met with the rootlet of some great tree, and
was taken up into its sap in spring, through tiny veins, and hardened
the next year into a piece of solid wood.&nbsp; And then how that tree
was cut down, and its logs, it may be, burnt upon the hearth, till the
little atom of mineral lay among the wood-ashes, and was shovelled out
and thrown upon the field and washed into the soil again, and taken
up by the roots of a clover plant, and became an atom of vegetable matter
once more.&nbsp; And then how, perhaps, a rabbit came by, and ate the
clover, and the grain of mineral became part of the rabbit; and then
how a hawk killed that rabbit, and ate it, and so the grain became part
of the hawk; and how the farmer shot the hawk, and it fell perchance
into a stream, and was carried down into the sea; and when its body
decayed, the little grain sank through the water, and was mingled with
the mud at the bottom of the sea.&nbsp; But do its wanderings stop there?&nbsp;
Not so, my child.&nbsp; Nothing upon this earth, as I told you once
before, continues in one stay.&nbsp; That grain of mineral might stay
at the bottom of the sea a thousand or ten thousand years, and yet the
time would come when Madam How would set to work on it again.&nbsp;
Slowly, perhaps, she would sink that mud so deep, and cover it up with
so many fresh beds of mud, or sand, or lime, that under the heavy weight,
and perhaps, too, under the heat of the inside of the earth, that Mud
would slowly change to hard Slate Rock; and ages after, it may be, Madam
How might melt that Slate Rock once more, and blast it out; and then
through the mouth of a volcano the little grain of mineral might rise
into the open air again to make fresh soil, as it had done thousands
of years before.&nbsp; For Madam How can manufacture many different
things out of the same materials.&nbsp; She may have so wrought with
that grain of mineral, that she may have formed it into part of a precious
stone, and men may dig it out of the rock, or pick it up in the river-bed,
and polish it, and set it, and wear it.&nbsp; Think of that&mdash;that
in the jewels which your mother or your sisters wear, or in your father&rsquo;s
signet ring, there may be atoms which were part of a live plant, or
a live animal, millions of years ago, and may be parts of a live plant
or a live animal millions of years hence.</p>
<p>Think over again, and learn by heart, the links of this endless chain
of change: Fire turned into Stone&mdash;Stone into Soil&mdash;Soil into
Plant&mdash;Plant into Animal&mdash;Animal into Soil&mdash;Soil into
Stone&mdash;Stone into Fire again&mdash;and then Fire into Stone again,
and the old thing run round once more.</p>
<p>So it is, and so it must be.&nbsp; For all things which are born
in Time must change in Time, and die in Time, till that Last Day of
this our little earth, in which,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Like to the baseless fabric of a vision,<br />
The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces,<br />
The solemn temples, the great globe itself,<br />
Yea, all things which inherit, shall dissolve,<br />
And, like an unsubstantial pageant faded,<br />
Leave not a rack behind.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So all things change and die, and so your body too must change and
die&mdash;but not yourself.&nbsp; Madam How made your body; and she
must unmake it again, as she unmakes all her works in Time and Space;
but you, child, your Soul, and Life, and Self, she did not make; and
over you she has no power.&nbsp; For you were not, like your body, created
in Time and Space; and you will endure though Time and Space should
be no more: because you are the child of the Living God, who gives to
each thing its own body, and can give you another body, even as seems
good to Him.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V&mdash;THE ICE-PLOUGH</h2>
<p>You want to know why I am so fond of that little bit of limestone,
no bigger than my hand, which lies upon the shelf; why I ponder over
it so often, and show it to all sensible people who come to see me?</p>
<p>I do so, not only for the sake of the person who gave it to me, but
because there is written on it a letter out of Madam How&rsquo;s alphabet,
which has taken wise men many a year to decipher.&nbsp; I could not
decipher that letter when first I saw the stone.&nbsp; More shame for
me, for I had seen it often before, and understood it well enough, in
many another page of Madam How&rsquo;s great book.&nbsp; Take the stone,
and see if you can find out anything strange about it.</p>
<p>Well, it is only a bit of marble as big as my hand, that looks as
if it had been, and really has been, broken off by a hammer.&nbsp; But
when you look again, you see there is a smooth scraped part on one edge,
that seems to have been rubbed against a stone.</p>
<p>Now look at that rubbed part, and tell me how it was done.</p>
<p>You have seen men often polish one stone on another, or scour floors
with a Bath brick, and you will guess at first that this was polished
so: but if it had been, then the rubbed place would have been flat:
but if you put your fingers over it, you will find that it is not flat.&nbsp;
It is rolled, fluted, channelled, so that the thing or things which
rubbed it must have been somewhat round.&nbsp; And it is covered, too,
with very fine and smooth scratches or grooves, all running over the
whole in the same line.&nbsp; Now what could have done that?</p>
<p>Of course a man could have done it, if he had taken a large round
stone in his hand, and worked the large channellings with that, and
then had taken fine sand and gravel upon the points of his fingers,
and worked the small scratches with that.&nbsp; But this stone came
from a place where man had, perhaps, never stood before,&mdash;ay, which,
perhaps, had never seen the light of day before since the world was
made; and as I happen to know that no man made the marks upon that stone,
we must set to work and think again for some tool of Madam How&rsquo;s
which may have made them.</p>
<p>And now I think you must give up guessing, and I must tell you the
answer to the riddle.&nbsp; Those marks were made by a hand which is
strong and yet gentle, tough and yet yielding, like the hand of a man;
a hand which handles and uses in a grip stronger than a giant&rsquo;s
its own carving tools, from the great boulder stone as large as this
whole room to the finest grain of sand.&nbsp; And that is ICE.</p>
<p>That piece of stone came from the side of the Rosenla&uuml;i glacier
in Switzerland, and it was polished by the glacier ice.&nbsp; The glacier
melted and shrank this last hot summer farther back than it had done
for many years, and left bare sheets of rock, which it had been scraping
at for ages, with all the marks fresh upon them.&nbsp; And that bit
was broken off and brought to me, who never saw a glacier myself, to
show me how the marks which the ice makes in Switzerland are exactly
the same as those which the ice has made in Snowdon and in the Highlands,
and many another place where I have traced them, and written a little,
too, about them in years gone by.&nbsp; And so I treasure this, as a
sign that Madam How&rsquo;s ways do not change nor her laws become broken;
that, as that great philosopher Sir Charles Lyell will tell you, when
you read his books, Madam How is making and unmaking the surface of
the earth now, by exactly the same means as she was making and unmaking
ages and ages since; and that what is going on slowly and surely in
the Alps in Switzerland was going on once here where we stand.</p>
<p>It is very difficult, I know, for a little boy like you to understand
how ice, and much more how soft snow, should have such strength that
it can grind this little stone, much more such strength as to grind
whole mountains into plains.&nbsp; You have never seen ice and snow
do harm.&nbsp; You cannot even recollect the Crimean Winter, as it was
called then; and well for you you cannot, considering all the misery
it brought at home and abroad.&nbsp; You cannot, I say, recollect the
Crimean Winter, when the Thames was frozen over above the bridges, and
the ice piled in little bergs ten to fifteen feet high, which lay, some
of them, stranded on the shores, about London itself, and did not melt,
if I recollect, until the end of May.&nbsp; You never stood, as I stood,
in the great winter of 1837-8 on Battersea Bridge, to see the ice break
up with the tide, and saw the great slabs and blocks leaping and piling
upon each other&rsquo;s backs, and felt the bridge tremble with their
shocks, and listened to their horrible grind and roar, till one got
some little picture in one&rsquo;s mind of what must be the breaking
up of an ice-floe in the Arctic regions, and what must be the danger
of a ship nipped in the ice and lifted up on high, like those in the
pictures of Arctic voyages which you are so fond of looking through.&nbsp;
You cannot recollect how that winter even in our little Blackwater Brook
the alder stems were all peeled white, and scarred, as if they had been
gnawed by hares and deer, simply by the rushing and scraping of the
ice,&mdash;a sight which gave me again a little picture of the destruction
which the ice makes of quays, and stages, and houses along the shore
upon the coasts of North America, when suddenly setting in with wind
and tide, it jams and piles up high inland, as you may read for yourself
some day in a delightful book called <i>Frost and Fire</i>.&nbsp; You
recollect none of these things.&nbsp; Ice and snow are to you mere playthings;
and you long for winter, that you may make snowballs and play hockey
and skate upon the ponds, and eat ice like a foolish boy till you make
your stomach ache.&nbsp; And I dare say you have said, like many another
boy, on a bright cheery ringing frosty day, &ldquo;Oh, that it would
be always winter!&rdquo;&nbsp; You little knew for what you asked.&nbsp;
You little thought what the earth would soon be like, if it were always
winter,&mdash;if one sheet of ice on the pond glued itself on to the
bottom of the last sheet, till the whole pond was a solid mass,&mdash;if
one snow-fall lay upon the top of another snow-fall till the moor was
covered many feet deep and the snow began sliding slowly down the glen
from Coombs&rsquo;s, burying the green fields, tearing the trees up
by their roots, burying gradually house, church, and village, and making
this place for a few thousand years what it was many thousand years
ago.&nbsp; Good-bye then, after a very few winters, to bees, and butterflies,
and singing-birds, and flowers; and good-bye to all vegetables, and
fruit, and bread; good-bye to cotton and woollen clothes.&nbsp; You
would have, if you were left alive, to dress in skins, and eat fish
and seals, if any came near enough to be caught.&nbsp; You would have
to live in a word, if you could live at all, as Esquimaux live now in
Arctic regions, and as people had to live in England ages since, in
the times when it was always winter, and icebergs floated between here
and Finchampstead.&nbsp; Oh no, my child: thank Heaven that it is not
always winter; and remember that winter ice and snow, though it is a
very good tool with which to make the land, must leave the land year
by year if that land is to be fit to live in.</p>
<p>I said that if the snow piled high enough upon the moor, it would
come down the glen in a few years through Coombs&rsquo;s Wood; and I
said then you would have a small glacier here&mdash;such a glacier (to
compare small things with great) as now comes down so many valleys in
the Alps, or has come down all the valleys of Greenland and Spitzbergen
till they reach the sea, and there end as cliffs of ice, from which
great icebergs snap off continually, and fall and float away, wandering
southward into the Atlantic for many a hundred miles.&nbsp; You have
seen drawings of such glaciers in Captain Cook&rsquo;s Voyages; and
you may see photographs of Swiss glaciers in any good London print-shop;
and therefore you have seen almost as much about them as I have seen,
and may judge for yourself how you would like to live where it is always
winter.</p>
<p>Now you must not ask me to tell you what a glacier is like, for I
have never seen one; at least, those which I have seen were more than
fifty miles away, looking like white clouds hanging on the gray mountain
sides.&nbsp; And it would be an impertinence&mdash;that means a meddling
with things which I have no business&mdash;to picture to you glaciers
which have been pictured so well and often by gentlemen who escape every
year from their hard work in town to find among the glaciers of the
Alps health and refreshment, and sound knowledge, and that most wholesome
and strengthening of all medicines, toil.</p>
<p>So you must read of them in such books as <i>Peaks, Passes, and Glaciers</i>,
and Mr. Willes&rsquo;s <i>Wanderings in the High Alps</i>, and Professor
Tyndall&rsquo;s different works; or you must look at them (as I just
now said) in photographs or in pictures.&nbsp; But when you do that,
or when you see a glacier for yourself, you must bear in mind what a
glacier means&mdash;that it is a river of ice, fed by a lake of snow.&nbsp;
The lake from which it springs is the eternal snow-field which stretches
for miles and miles along the mountain tops, fed continually by fresh
snow-storms falling from the sky.&nbsp; That snow slides off into the
valleys hour by hour, and as it rushes down is ground and pounded, and
thawed and frozen again into a sticky paste of ice, which flows slowly
but surely till it reaches the warm valley at the mountain foot, and
there melts bit by bit.&nbsp; The long black lines which you see winding
along the white and green ice of the glacier are the stones which have
fallen from the cliffs above.&nbsp; They will be dropped at the end
of the glacier, and mixed with silt and sand and other stones which
have come down inside the glacier itself, and piled up in the field
in great mounds, which are called moraines, such as you may see and
walk on in Scotland many a time, though you might never guess what they
are.</p>
<p>The river which runs out at the glacier foot is, you must remember,
all foul and milky with the finest mud; and that mud is the grinding
of the rocks over which the glacier has been crawling down, and scraping
them as it scraped my bit of stone with pebbles and with sand.&nbsp;
And this is the alphabet, which, if you learn by heart, you will learn
to understand how Madam How uses her great ice-plough to plough down
her old mountains, and spread the stuff of them about the valleys to
make rich straths of fertile soil.&nbsp; Nay, so immensely strong, because
immensely heavy, is the share of this her great ice-plough, that some
will tell you (and it is not for me to say that they are wrong) that
with it she has ploughed out all the mountain lakes in Europe and in
North America; that such lakes, for instance, as Ullswater or Windermere
have been scooped clean out of the solid rock by ice which came down
these glaciers in old times.&nbsp; And be sure of this, that next to
Madam How&rsquo;s steam-pump and her rain-spade, her great ice-plough
has had, and has still, the most to do with making the ground on which
we live.</p>
<p>Do I mean that there were ever glaciers here?&nbsp; No, I do not.&nbsp;
There have been glaciers in Scotland in plenty.&nbsp; And if any Scotch
boy shall read this book, it will tell him presently how to find the
marks of them far and wide over his native land.&nbsp; But as you, my
child, care most about this country in which you live, I will show you
in any gravel-pit, or hollow lane upon the moor, the marks, not of a
glacier, which is an ice-river, but of a whole sea of ice.</p>
<p>Let us come up to the pit upon the top of the hill, and look carefully
at what we see there.&nbsp; The lower part of the pit of course is a
solid rock of sand.&nbsp; On the top of that is a cap of gravel, five,
six, ten feet thick.&nbsp; Now the sand was laid down there by water
at the bottom of an old sea; and therefore the top of it would naturally
be flat and smooth, as the sands at Hunstanton or at Bournemouth are;
and the gravel, if it was laid down by water, would naturally lie flat
on it again: but it does not.&nbsp; See how the top of the sand is dug
out into deep waves and pits, filled up with gravel.&nbsp; And see,
too, how over some of the gravel you get sand again, and then gravel
again, and then sand again, till you cannot tell where one fairly begins
and the other ends.&nbsp; Why, here are little dots of gravel, six or
eight feet down, in what looks the solid sand rock, yet the sand must
have been opened somehow to put the gravel in.</p>
<p>You say you have seen that before.&nbsp; You have seen the same curious
twisting of the gravel and sand into each other on the top of Farley
Hill, and in the new cutting on Minley Hill; and, best of all, in the
railway cutting between Ascot and Sunningdale, where upon the top the
white sand and gravel is arranged in red and brown waves, and festoons,
and curlicues, almost like Prince of Wales&rsquo;s feathers.&nbsp; Yes,
that last is a beautiful section of ice-work; so beautiful, that I hope
to have it photographed some day.</p>
<p>Now, how did ice do this?</p>
<p>Well, I was many a year before I found out that, and I dare say I
never should have found it out for myself.&nbsp; A gentleman named Trimmer,
who, alas! is now dead, was, I believe, the first to find it out.&nbsp;
He knew that along the coast of Labrador, and other cold parts of North
America, and on the shores, too, of the great river St. Lawrence, the
stranded icebergs, and the ice-foot, as it is called, which is continually
forming along the freezing shores, grub and plough every tide into the
mud and sand, and shove up before them, like a ploughshare, heaps of
dirt; and that, too, the ice itself is full of dirt, of sand and stones,
which it may have brought from hundreds of miles away; and that, as
this ploughshare of dirty ice grubs onward, the nose of the plough is
continually being broken off, and left underneath the mud; and that,
when summer comes, and the ice melts, the mud falls back into the place
where the ice had been, and covers up the gravel which was in the ice.&nbsp;
So, what between the grubbing of the ice-plough into the mud, and the
dirt which it leaves behind when it melts, the stones, and sand, and
mud upon the shore are jumbled up into curious curved and twisted layers,
exactly like those which Mr. Trimmer saw in certain gravel-pits.&nbsp;
And when I first read about that, I said, &ldquo;And exactly like what
I have been seeing in every gravel-pit round here, and trying to guess
how they could have been made by currents of water, and yet never could
make any guess which would do.&rdquo;&nbsp; But after that it was all
explained to me; and I said, &ldquo;Honour to the man who has let Madam
How teach him what she had been trying to teach me for fifteen years,
while I was too stupid to learn it.&nbsp; Now I am certain, as certain
as I can be of any earthly thing, that the whole of these Windsor Forest
Flats were ages ago ploughed and harrowed over and over again, by ice-floes
and icebergs drifting and stranding in a shallow sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And if you say, my dear child, as some people will say, that it is
like building a large house upon a single brick to be sure that there
was an iceberg sea here, just because I see a few curlicues in the gravel
and sand&mdash;then I must tell you that there are sometimes&mdash;not
often, but sometimes&mdash;pages in Madam How&rsquo;s book in which
one single letter tells you as much as a whole chapter; in which if
you find one little fact, and know what it really means, it makes you
certain that a thousand other great facts have happened.&nbsp; You may
be astonished: but you cannot deny your own eyes, and your own common
sense.&nbsp; You feel like Robinson Crusoe when, walking along the shore
of his desert island, he saw for the first time the print of a man&rsquo;s
foot in the sand.&nbsp; How it could have got there without a miracle
he could not dream.&nbsp; But there it was.&nbsp; One footprint was
as good as the footprints of a whole army would have been.&nbsp; A man
had been there; and more men might come.&nbsp; And in fear of the savages&mdash;and
if you have read Robinson Crusoe you know how just his fears were&mdash;he
went home trembling and loaded his muskets, and barricaded his cave,
and passed sleepless nights watching for the savages who might come,
and who came after all.</p>
<p>And so there are certain footprints in geology which there is no
mistaking; and the prints of the ice-plough are among them.</p>
<p>For instance:&mdash;When they were trenching the new plantation close
to Wellington College station, the men turned up out of the ground a
great many Sarsden stones; that is, pieces of hard sugary sand, such
as Stonehenge is made of.&nbsp; And when I saw these I said, &ldquo;I
suspect these were brought here by icebergs:&rdquo; but I was not sure,
and waited.&nbsp; As the men dug on, they dug up a great many large
flints, with bottle-green coats.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I
am sure.&nbsp; For I know where these flints must have come from.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And for reasons which would be too long to tell you here, I said, &ldquo;Some
time or other, icebergs have been floating northward from the Hog&rsquo;s
Back over Aldershot and Farnborough, and have been trying to get into
the Vale of Thames by the slope at Wellington College station; and they
have stranded, and dropped these flints.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I am so sure
of that, that if I found myself out wrong after all I should be at my
wit&rsquo;s end; for I should know that I was wrong about a hundred
things besides.</p>
<p>Or again, if you ever go up Deeside in Scotland, towards Balmoral,
and turn up Glen Muick, towards Alt-na-guisach, of which you may see
a picture in the Queen&rsquo;s last book, you will observe standing
on your right hand, just above Birk Hall, three pretty rounded knolls,
which they call the Coile Hills.&nbsp; You may easily know them by their
being covered with beautiful green grass instead of heather.&nbsp; That
is because they are made of serpentine or volcanic rock, which (as you
have seen) often cuts into beautiful red and green marble; and which
also carries a very rich soil because it is full of magnesia.&nbsp;
If you go up those hills, you get a glorious view&mdash;the mountains
sweeping round you where you stand, up to the top of Lochnagar, with
its bleak walls a thousand feet perpendicular, and gullies into which
the sun never shines, and round to the dark fir forests of the Ballochbuie.&nbsp;
That is the arc of the bow; and the cord of the bow is the silver Dee,
more than a thousand feet below you; and in the centre of the cord,
where the arrow would be fitted in, stands Balmoral, with its Castle,
and its Gardens, and its Park, and pleasant cottages and homesteads
all around.&nbsp; And when you have looked at the beautiful amphitheatre
of forest at your feet, and looked too at the great mountains to the
westward, and Benaun, and Benna-buird and Benna-muicdhui, with their
bright patches of eternal snow, I should advise you to look at the rock
on which you stand, and see what you see there.&nbsp; And you will see
that on the side of the Coiles towards Lochnagar, and between the knolls
of them, are scattered streams, as it were, of great round boulder stones&mdash;which
are not serpentine, but granite from the top of Lochnagar, five miles
away.&nbsp; And you will see that the knolls of serpentine rock, or
at least their backs and shoulders towards Lochnagar, are all smoothed
and polished till they are as round as the backs of sheep, &ldquo;roches
moutonn&eacute;es,&rdquo; as the French call ice-polished rocks; and
then, if you understand what that means, you will say, as I said, &ldquo;I
am perfectly certain that this great basin between me and Lochnagar,
which is now 3000 feet deep of empty air was once filled up with ice
to the height of the hills on which I stand&mdash;about 1700 feet high&mdash;and
that that ice ran over into Glen Muick, between these pretty knolls,
and covered the ground where Birk Hall now stands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And more:&mdash;When you see growing on those knolls of serpentine
a few pretty little Alpine plants, which have no business down there
so low, you will have a fair right to say, as I said, &ldquo;The seeds
of these plants were brought by the ice ages and ages since from off
the mountain range of Lochnagar, and left here, nestling among the rocks,
to found a fresh colony, far from their old mountain home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If I could take you with me up to Scotland,&mdash;take you, for instance,
along the Tay, up the pass of Dunkeld, or up Strathmore towards Aberdeen,
or up the Dee towards Braemar,&mdash;I could show you signs, which cannot
be mistaken, of the time when Scotland was, just like Spitzbergen or
like Greenland now, covered in one vast sheet of snow and ice from year&rsquo;s
end to year&rsquo;s end; when glaciers were ploughing out its valleys,
icebergs were breaking off the icy cliffs and floating out to sea; when
not a bird, perhaps, was to be seen save sea-fowl, not a plant upon
the rocks but a few lichens, and Alpine saxifrages, and such like&mdash;desolation
and cold and lifeless everywhere.&nbsp; That ice-time went on for ages
and for ages; and yet it did not go on in vain.&nbsp; Through it Madam
How was ploughing down the mountains of Scotland to make all those rich
farms which stretch from the north side of the Frith of Forth into Sutherlandshire.&nbsp;
I could show you everywhere the green banks and knolls of earth, which
Scotch people call &ldquo;kames&rdquo; and &ldquo;tomans&rdquo;&mdash;perhaps
brought down by ancient glaciers, or dropped by ancient icebergs&mdash;now
so smooth and green through summer and through winter, among the wild
heath and the rough peat-moss, that the old Scots fancied, and I dare
say Scotch children fancy still, fairies dwelt inside.&nbsp; If you
laid your ear against the mounds, you might hear the fairy music, sweet
and faint, beneath the ground.&nbsp; If you watched the mound at night,
you might see the fairies dancing the turf short and smooth, or riding
out on fairy horses, with green silk clothes and jingling bells.&nbsp;
But if you fell asleep upon the mounds, the fairy queen came out and
carried you for seven years into Fairyland, till you awoke again in
the same place, to find all changed around you, and yourself grown thin
and old.</p>
<p>These are all dreams and fancies&mdash;untrue, not because they are
too strange and wonderful, but because they are not strange and wonderful
enough: for more wonderful sure than any fairy tale it is, that Madam
How should make a rich and pleasant land by the brute force of ice.</p>
<p>And were there any men and women in that old age of ice?&nbsp; That
is a long story, and a dark one too; we will talk of it next time.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI&mdash;THE TRUE FAIRY TALE</h2>
<p>You asked if there were men in England when the country was covered
with ice and snow.&nbsp; Look at this, and judge for yourself.</p>
<p>What is it? a piece of old mortar?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; But mortar which
was made Madam How herself, and not by any man.&nbsp; And what is in
it?&nbsp; A piece of flint and some bits of bone.&nbsp; But look at
that piece of flint.&nbsp; It is narrow, thin, sharp-edged: quite different
in shape from any bit of flint which you or I ever saw among the hundreds
of thousands of broken bits of gravel which we tread on here all day
long; and here are some more bits like it, which came from the same
place&mdash;all very much the same shape, like rough knives or razor
blades; and here is a core of flint, the remaining part of a large flint,
from which, as you may see, blades like those have been split off.&nbsp;
Those flakes of flint, my child, were split off by men; even your young
eyes ought to be able to see that.&nbsp; And here are other pieces of
flint&mdash;pear-shaped, but flattened, sharp at one end and left rounded
at the other, which look like spear-heads, or arrow-heads, or pointed
axes, or pointed hatchets&mdash;even your young eyes can see that these
must have been made by man.&nbsp; And they are, I may tell you, just
like the tools of flint, or of obsidian, which is volcanic glass, and
which savages use still where they have not iron.&nbsp; There is a great
obsidian knife, you know, in a house in this very parish, which came
from Mexico; and your eye can tell you how like it is to these flint
ones.&nbsp; But these flint tools are very old.&nbsp; If you crack a
fresh flint, you will see that its surface is gray, and somewhat rough,
so that it sticks to your tongue.&nbsp; These tools are smooth and shiny:
and the edges of some of them are a little rubbed from being washed
about in gravel; while the iron in the gravel has stained them reddish,
which it would take hundreds and perhaps thousands of years to do.&nbsp;
There are little rough markings, too, upon some of them, which, if you
look at through a magnifying glass, are iron, crystallised into the
shape of little sea-weeds and trees&mdash;another sign that they are
very very old.&nbsp; And what is more, near the place where these flint
flakes come from there are no flints in the ground for hundreds of miles;
so that men must have brought them there ages and ages since.&nbsp;
And to tell you plainly, these are scrapers such as the Esquimaux in
North America still use to scrape the flesh off bones, and to clean
the insides of skins.</p>
<p>But did these people (savages perhaps) live when the country was
icy cold?&nbsp; Look at the bits of bone.&nbsp; They have been split,
you see, lengthways; that, I suppose, was to suck the marrow out of
them, as savages do still.&nbsp; But to what animal do the bones belong?&nbsp;
That is the question, and one which I could not have answered you, if
wiser men than I am could not have told me.</p>
<p>They are the bones of reindeer&mdash;such reindeer as are now found
only in Lapland and the half-frozen parts of North America, close to
the Arctic circle, where they have six months day and six months night.&nbsp;
You have read of Laplanders, and how they drive reindeer in their sledges,
and live upon reindeer milk; and you have read of Esquimaux, who hunt
seals and walrus, and live in houses of ice, lighted by lamps fed with
the same blubber on which they feed themselves.&nbsp; I need not tell
you about them.</p>
<p>Now comes the question&mdash;Whence did these flints and bones come?&nbsp;
They came out of a cave in Dordogne, in the heart of sunny France,&mdash;far
away to the south, where it is hotter every summer than it was here
even this summer, from among woods of box and evergreen oak, and vineyards
of rich red wine.&nbsp; In that warm land once lived savages, who hunted
amid ice and snow the reindeer, and with the reindeer animals stranger
still.</p>
<p>And now I will tell you a fairy tale: to make you understand it at
all I must put it in the shape of a tale.&nbsp; I call it a fairy tale,
because it is so strange; indeed I think I ought to call it the fairy
tale of all fairy tales, for by the time we get to the end of it I think
it will explain to you how our forefathers got to believe in fairies,
and trolls, and elves, and scratlings, and all strange little people
who were said to haunt the mountains and the caves.</p>
<p>Well, once upon a time, so long ago that no man can tell when, the
land was so much higher, that between England and Ireland, and, what
is more, between England and Norway, was firm dry land.&nbsp; The country
then must have looked&mdash;at least we know it looked so in Norfolk&mdash;very
like what our moors look like here.&nbsp; There were forests of Scotch
fir, and of spruce too, which is not wild in England now, though you
may see plenty in every plantation.&nbsp; There were oaks and alders,
yews and sloes, just as there are in our woods now.&nbsp; There was
buck-bean in the bogs, as there is in Larmer&rsquo;s and Heath pond;
and white and yellow water-lilies, horn-wort, and pond-weeds, just as
there are now in our ponds.&nbsp; There were wild horses, wild deer,
and wild oxen, those last of an enormous size.&nbsp; There were little
yellow roe-deer, which will not surprise you, for there are hundreds
and thousands in Scotland to this day; and, as you know, they will thrive
well enough in our woods now.&nbsp; There were beavers too: but that
must not surprise you, for there were beavers in South Wales long after
the Norman Conquest, and there are beavers still in the mountain glens
of the south-east of France.&nbsp; There were honest little water-rats
too, who I dare say sat up on their hind legs like monkeys, nibbling
the water-lily pods, thousands of years ago, as they do in our ponds
now.&nbsp; Well, so far we have come to nothing strange: but now begins
the fairy tale.&nbsp; Mixed with all these animals, there wandered about
great herds of elephants and rhinoceroses; not smooth-skinned, mind,
but covered with hair and wool, like those which are still found sticking
out of the everlasting ice cliffs, at the mouth of the Lena and other
Siberian rivers, with the flesh, and skin, and hair so fresh upon them,
that the wild wolves tear it off, and snarl and growl over the carcase
of monsters who were frozen up thousands of years ago.&nbsp; And with
them, stranger still, were great hippopotamuses; who came, perhaps,
northward in summer time along the sea-shore and down the rivers, having
spread hither all the way from Africa; for in those days, you must understand,
Sicily, and Italy, and Malta&mdash;look at your map&mdash;were joined
to the coast of Africa: and so it may be was the rock of Gibraltar itself;
and over the sea where the Straits of Gibraltar now flow was firm dry
land, over which hy&aelig;nas and leopards, elephants and rhinoceroses
ranged into Spain; for their bones are found at this day in the Gibraltar
caves.&nbsp; And this is the first chapter of my fairy tale.</p>
<p>Now while all this was going on, and perhaps before this began, the
climate was getting colder year by year&mdash;we do not know how; and,
what is more, the land was sinking; and it sank so deep that at last
nothing was left out of the water but the tops of the mountains in Ireland,
and Scotland, and Wales.&nbsp; It sank so deep that it left beds of
shells belonging to the Arctic regions nearly two thousand feet high
upon the mountain side.&nbsp; And so</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It grew wondrous cold,<br />
And ice mast-high came floating by,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As green as emerald.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But there were no masts then to measure the icebergs by, nor any
ship nor human being there.&nbsp; All we know is that the icebergs brought
with them vast quantities of mud, which sank to the bottom, and covered
up that pleasant old forest-land in what is called boulder-clay; clay
full of bits of broken rock, and of blocks of stone so enormous, that
nothing but an iceberg could have carried them.&nbsp; So all the animals
were drowned or driven away, and nothing was left alive perhaps, except
a few little hardy plants which clung about cracks and gullies in the
mountain tops; and whose descendants live there still.&nbsp; That was
a dreadful time; the worst, perhaps, of all the age of Ice; and so ends
the second chapter of my fairy tale.</p>
<p>Now for my third chapter.&nbsp; &ldquo;When things come to the worst,&rdquo;
says the proverb, &ldquo;they commonly mend;&rdquo; and so did this
poor frozen and drowned land of England and France and Germany, though
it mended very slowly.&nbsp; The land began to rise out of the sea once
more, and rose till it was perhaps as high as it had been at first,
and hundreds of feet higher than it is now: but still it was very cold,
covered, in Scotland at least, with one great sea of ice and glaciers
descending down into the sea, as I said when I spoke to you about the
Ice-Plough.&nbsp; But as the land rose, and grew warmer too, while it
rose, the wild beasts who had been driven out by the great drowning
came gradually back again.&nbsp; As the bottom of the old icy sea turned
into dry land, and got covered with grasses, and weeds, and shrubs once
more, elephants, rhinoceroses, hippopotamuses, oxen&mdash;sometimes
the same species, sometimes slightly different ones&mdash;returned to
France, and then to England (for there was no British Channel then to
stop them); and with them came other strange animals, especially the
great Irish elk, as he is called, as large as the largest horse, with
horns sometimes ten feet across.&nbsp; A pair of those horns with the
skull you have seen yourself, and can judge what a noble animal he must
have been.&nbsp; Enormous bears came too, and hy&aelig;nas, and a tiger
or lion (I cannot say which), as large as the largest Bengal tiger now
to be seen in India.</p>
<p>And in those days&mdash;we cannot, of course, exactly say when&mdash;there
came&mdash;first I suppose into the south and east of France, and then
gradually onward into England and Scotland and Ireland&mdash;creatures
without any hair to keep them warm, or scales to defend them, without
horns or tusks to fight with, or teeth to worry and bite; the weakest
you would have thought of the beasts, and yet stronger than all the
animals, because they were Men, with reasonable souls.&nbsp; Whence
they came we cannot tell, nor why; perhaps from mere hunting after food,
and love of wandering and being independent and alone.&nbsp; Perhaps
they came into that icy land for fear of stronger and cleverer people
than themselves; for we have no proof, my child, none at all, that they
were the first men that trod this earth.&nbsp; But be that as it may,
they came; and so cunning were these savage men, and so brave likewise,
though they had no iron among them, only flint and sharpened bones,
yet they contrived to kill and eat the mammoths, and the giant oxen,
and the wild horses, and the reindeer, and to hold their own against
the hy&aelig;nas, and tigers, and bears, simply because they had wits,
and the dumb animals had none.&nbsp; And that is the strangest part
to me of all my fairy tale.&nbsp; For what a man&rsquo;s wits are, and
why he has them, and therefore is able to invent and to improve, while
even the cleverest ape has none, and therefore can invent and improve
nothing, and therefore cannot better himself, but must remain from father
to son, and father to son again, a stupid, pitiful, ridiculous ape,
while men can go on civilising themselves, and growing richer and more
comfortable, wiser and happier, year by year&mdash;how that comes to
pass, I say, is to me a wonder and a prodigy and a miracle, stranger
than all the most fantastic marvels you ever read in fairy tales.</p>
<p>You may find the flint weapons which these old savages used buried
in many a gravel-pit up and down France and the south of England; but
you will find none here, for the gravel here was made (I am told) at
the beginning of the ice-time, before the north of England sunk into
the sea, and therefore long, long before men came into this land.&nbsp;
But most of their remains are found in caves which water has eaten out
of the limestone rocks, like that famous cave of Kent&rsquo;s Hole at
Torquay.&nbsp; In it, and in many another cave, lie the bones of animals
which the savages ate, and cracked to get the marrow out of them, mixed
up with their flint-weapons and bone harpoons, and sometimes with burnt
ashes and with round stones, used perhaps to heat water, as savages
do now, all baked together into a hard paste or breccia by the lime.&nbsp;
These are in the water, and are often covered with a floor of stalagmite
which has dripped from the roof above and hardened into stone.&nbsp;
Of these caves and their beautiful wonders I must tell you another day.&nbsp;
We must keep now to our fairy tale.&nbsp; But in these caves, no doubt,
the savages lived; for not only have weapons been found in them, but
actually drawings scratched (I suppose with flint) on bone or mammoth
ivory&mdash;drawings of elk, and bull, and horse, and ibex&mdash;and
one, which was found in France, of the great mammoth himself, the woolly
elephant, with a mane on his shoulders like a lion&rsquo;s mane.&nbsp;
So you see that one of the earliest fancies of this strange creature,
called man, was to draw, as you and your schoolfellows love to draw,
and copy what you see, you know not why.&nbsp; Remember that.&nbsp;
You like to draw; but why you like it neither you nor any man can tell.&nbsp;
It is one of the mysteries of human nature; and that poor savage clothed
in skins, dirty it may be, and more ignorant than you (happily) can
conceive, when he sat scratching on ivory in the cave the figures of
the animals he hunted, was proving thereby that he had the same wonderful
and mysterious human nature as you&mdash;that he was the kinsman of
every painter and sculptor who ever felt it a delight and duty to copy
the beautiful works of God.</p>
<p>Sometimes, again, especially in Denmark, these savages have left
behind upon the shore mounds of dirt, which are called there &ldquo;kj&ouml;kken-m&ouml;ddings&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;kitchen-middens&rdquo;
as they would say in Scotland, &ldquo;kitchen-dirtheaps&rdquo; as we
should say here down South&mdash;and a very good name for them that
is; for they are made up of the shells of oysters, cockles, mussels,
and periwinkles, and other shore-shells besides, on which those poor
creatures fed; and mingled with them are broken bones of beasts, and
fishes, and birds, and flint knives, and axes, and sling stones; and
here and there hearths, on which they have cooked their meals in some
rough way.&nbsp; And that is nearly all we know about them; but this
we know from the size of certain of the shells, and from other reasons
which you would not understand, that these mounds were made an enormous
time ago, when the water of the Baltic Sea was far more salt than it
is now.</p>
<p>But what has all this to do with my fairy tale?&nbsp; This:&mdash;</p>
<p>Suppose that these people, after all, had been fairies?</p>
<p>I am in earnest.&nbsp; Of course, I do not mean that these folk could
make themselves invisible, or that they had any supernatural powers&mdash;any
more, at least, than you and I have&mdash;or that they were anything
but savages; but this I do think, that out of old stories of these savages
grew up the stories of fairies, elves, and trolls, and scratlings, and
cluricaunes, and ogres, of which you have read so many.</p>
<p>When stronger and bolder people, like the Irish, and the Highlanders
of Scotland, and the Gauls of France, came northward with their bronze
and iron weapons; and still more, when our own forefathers, the Germans
and the Norsemen, came, these poor little savages with their flint arrows
and axes, were no match for them, and had to run away northward, or
to be all killed out; for people were fierce and cruel in those old
times, and looked on every one of a different race from themselves as
a natural enemy.&nbsp; They had not learnt&mdash;alas! too many have
not learned it yet&mdash;that all men are brothers for the sake of Jesus
Christ our Lord.&nbsp; So these poor savages were driven out, till none
were left, save the little Lapps up in the north of Norway, where they
live to this day.</p>
<p>But stories of them, and of how they dwelt in caves, and had strange
customs, and used poisoned weapons, and how the elf-bolts (as their
flint arrow-heads are still called) belonged to them, lingered on, and
were told round the fire on winter nights and added to, and played with
half in fun, till a hundred legends sprang up about them, which used
once to be believed by grown-up folk, but which now only amuse children.&nbsp;
And because some of these savages were very short, as the Lapps and
Esquimaux are now, the story grew of their being so small that they
could make themselves invisible; and because others of them were (but
probably only a few) very tall and terrible, the story grew that there
were giants in that old world, like that famous Gogmagog, whom Brutus
and his Britons met (so old fables tell), when they landed first at
Plymouth, and fought him, and threw him over the cliff.&nbsp; Ogres,
too&mdash;of whom you read in fairy tales&mdash;I am afraid that there
were such people once, even here in Europe; strong and terrible savages,
who ate human beings.&nbsp; Of course, the legends and tales about them
became ridiculous and exaggerated as they passed from mouth to mouth
over the Christmas fire, in the days when no one could read or write.&nbsp;
But that the tales began by being true any one may well believe who
knows how many cannibal savages there are in the world even now.&nbsp;
I think that, if ever there was an ogre in the world, he must have been
very like a certain person who lived, or was buried, in a cave in the
Neanderthal, between Elberfeld and Dusseldorf, on the Lower Rhine.&nbsp;
The skull and bones which were found there (and which are very famous
now among scientific men) belonged to a personage whom I should have
been very sorry to meet, and still more to let you meet, in the wild
forest; to a savage of enormous strength of limb (and I suppose of jaw)
likewise</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;like an ape,<br />
With forehead villainous low,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>who could have eaten you if he would; and (I fear) also would have
eaten you if he could.&nbsp; Such savages may have lingered (I believe,
from the old ballads and romances, that they did linger) for a long
time in lonely forests and mountain caves, till they were all killed
out by warriors who wore mail-armour and carried steel sword, and battle-axe,
and lance.</p>
<p>But had these people any religion?</p>
<p>My dear child, we cannot know, and need not know.&nbsp; But we know
this&mdash;that God beholds all the heathen.&nbsp; He fashions the hearts
of them, and understandeth all their works.&nbsp; And we know also that
He is just and good.&nbsp; These poor folks were, I doubt not, happy
enough in their way; and we are bound to believe (for we have no proof
against it), that most of them were honest and harmless enough likewise.&nbsp;
Of course, ogres and cannibals, and cruel and brutal persons (if there
were any among them), deserved punishment&mdash;and punishment, I do
not doubt, they got.&nbsp; But, of course, again, none of them knew
things which you know; but for that very reason they were not bound
to do many things which you are bound to do.&nbsp; For those to whom
little is given, of them shall little be required.&nbsp; What their
religion was like, or whether they had any religion at all, we cannot
tell.&nbsp; But this we can tell, that known unto God are all His works
from the creation of the world; and that His mercy is over all His works,
and He hateth nothing that He has made.&nbsp; These men and women, whatever
they were, were God&rsquo;s work; and therefore we may comfort ourselves
with the certainty that, whether or not they knew God, God knew them.</p>
<p>And so ends my fairy tale.</p>
<p>But is it not a wonderful tale?&nbsp; More wonderful, if you will
think over it, than any story invented by man.&nbsp; But so it always
is.&nbsp; &ldquo;Truth,&rdquo; wise men tell us, &ldquo;is stranger
than fiction.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even a child like you will see that it must
be so, if you will but recollect who makes fiction, and who makes facts.</p>
<p>Man makes fiction: he invents stories, pretty enough, fantastical
enough.&nbsp; But out of what does he make them up?&nbsp; Out of a few
things in this great world which he has seen, and heard, and felt, just
as he makes up his dreams.&nbsp; But who makes truth?&nbsp; Who makes
facts?&nbsp; Who, but God?</p>
<p>Then truth is as much larger than fiction, as God is greater than
man; as much larger as the whole universe is larger than the little
corner of it that any man, even the greatest poet or philosopher, can
see; and as much grander, and as much more beautiful, and as much more
strange.&nbsp; For one is the whole, and the other is one, a few tiny
scraps of the whole.&nbsp; The one is the work of God; the other is
the work of man.&nbsp; Be sure that no man can ever fancy anything strange,
unexpected, and curious, without finding if he had eyes to see, a hundred
things around his feet more strange, more unexpected, more curious,
actually ready-made already by God.&nbsp; You are fond of fairy tales,
because they are fanciful, and like your dreams.&nbsp; My dear child,
as your eyes open to the true fairy tale which Madam How can tell you
all day long, nursery stories will seem to you poor and dull.&nbsp;
All those feelings in you which your nursery tales call out,&mdash;imagination,
wonder, awe, pity, and I trust too, hope and love&mdash;will be called
out, I believe, by the Tale of all Tales, the true &ldquo;M&auml;rchen
allen M&auml;rchen,&rdquo; so much more fully and strongly and purely,
that you will feel that novels and story-books are scarcely worth your
reading, as long as you can read the great green book, of which every
bud is a letter, and every tree a page.</p>
<p>Wonder if you will.&nbsp; You cannot wonder too much.&nbsp; That
you might wonder all your life long, God put you into this wondrous
world, and gave you that faculty of wonder which he has not given to
the brutes; which is at once the mother of sound science, and a pledge
of immortality in a world more wondrous even than this.&nbsp; But wonder
at the right thing, not at the wrong; at the real miracles and prodigies,
not at the sham.&nbsp; Wonder not at the world of man.&nbsp; Waste not
your admiration, interest, hope on it, its pretty toys, gay fashions,
fine clothes, tawdry luxuries, silly amusements.&nbsp; Wonder at the
works of God.&nbsp; You will not, perhaps, take my advice yet.&nbsp;
The world of man looks so pretty, that you will needs have your peep
at it, and stare into its shop windows; and if you can, go to a few
of its stage plays, and dance at a few of its balls.&nbsp; Ah&mdash;well&mdash;After
a wild dream comes an uneasy wakening; and after too many sweet things,
comes a sick headache.&nbsp; And one morning you will awake, I trust
and pray, from the world of man to the world of God, and wonder where
wonder is due, and worship where worship is due.&nbsp; You will awake
like a child who has been at a pantomime over night, staring at the
&ldquo;fairy halls,&rdquo; which are all paint and canvas; and the &ldquo;dazzling
splendours,&rdquo; which are gas and oil; and the &ldquo;magic transformations,&rdquo;
which are done with ropes and pulleys; and the &ldquo;brilliant elves,&rdquo;
who are poor little children out of the next foul alley; and the harlequin
and clown, who through all their fun are thinking wearily over the old
debts which they must pay, and the hungry mouths at home which they
must feed: and so, having thought it all wondrously glorious, and quite
a fairy land, slips tired and stupid into bed, and wakes next morning
to see the pure light shining in through the delicate frost-lace on
the window-pane, and looks out over fields of virgin snow, and watches
the rosy dawn and cloudless blue, and the great sun rising to the music
of cawing rooks and piping stares, and says, &ldquo;This is the true
wonder.&nbsp; This is the true glory.&nbsp; The theatre last night was
the fairy land of man; but this is the fairy land of God.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII&mdash;THE CHALK-CARTS</h2>
<p>What do you want to know about next?&nbsp; More about the caves in
which the old savages lived,&mdash;how they were made, and how the curious
things inside them got there, and so forth.</p>
<p>Well, we will talk about that in good time: but now&mdash;What is
that coming down the hill?</p>
<p>Oh, only some chalk-carts.</p>
<p>Only some chalk-carts?&nbsp; It seems to me that these chalk-carts
are the very things we want; that if we follow them far enough&mdash;I
do not mean with our feet along the public road, but with our thoughts
along a road which, I am sorry to say, the public do not yet know much
about&mdash;we shall come to a cave, and understand how a cave is made.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, do not be in a hurry to say, &ldquo;Only a chalk-cart,&rdquo;
or only a mouse, or only a dead leaf.&nbsp; Chalk-carts, like mice,
and dead leaves, and most other matters in the universe are very curious
and odd things in the eyes of wise and reasonable people.&nbsp; Whenever
I hear young men saying &ldquo;only&rdquo; this and &ldquo;only&rdquo;
that, I begin to suspect them of belonging, not to the noble army of
sages&mdash;much less to the most noble army of martyrs,&mdash;but to
the ignoble army of noodles, who think nothing interesting or important
but dinners, and balls, and races, and back-biting their neighbours;
and I should be sorry to see you enlisting in that regiment when you
grow up.&nbsp; But think&mdash;are not chalk-carts very odd and curious
things?&nbsp; I think they are.&nbsp; To my mind, it is a curious question
how men ever thought of inventing wheels; and, again, when they first
thought of it.&nbsp; It is a curious question, too, how men ever found
out that they could make horses work for them, and so began to tame
them, instead of eating them, and a curious question (which I think
we shall never get answered) when the first horse-tamer lived, and in
what country.&nbsp; And a very curious, and, to me, a beautiful sight
it is, to see those two noble horses obeying that little boy, whom they
could kill with a single kick.</p>
<p>But, beside all this, there is a question, which ought to be a curious
one to you (for I suspect you cannot answer it)&mdash;Why does the farmer
take the trouble to send his cart and horses eight miles and more, to
draw in chalk from Odiham chalk-pit?</p>
<p>Oh, he is going to put it on the land, of course.&nbsp; They are
chalking the bit at the top of the next field, where the copse was grubbed.</p>
<p>But what good will he do by putting chalk on it?&nbsp; Chalk is not
rich and fertile, like manure, it is altogether poor, barren stuff:
you know that, or ought to know it.&nbsp; Recollect the chalk cuttings
and banks on the railway between Basingstoke and Winchester&mdash;how
utterly barren they are.&nbsp; Though they have been open these thirty
years, not a blade of grass, hardly a bit of moss, has grown on them,
or will grow, perhaps, for centuries.</p>
<p>Come, let us find out something about the chalk before we talk about
the caves.&nbsp; The chalk is here, and the caves are not; and &ldquo;Learn
from the thing that lies nearest you&rdquo; is as good a rule as &ldquo;Do
the duty which lies nearest you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let us come into the grubbed
bit, and ask the farmer&mdash;there he is in his gig.</p>
<p>Well, old friend, and how are you?&nbsp; Here is a little boy who
wants to know why you are putting chalk on your field.</p>
<p>Does he then?&nbsp; If he ever tries to farm round here, he will
have to learn for his first rule&mdash;No chalk, no wheat.</p>
<p>But why?</p>
<p>Why, is more than I can tell, young squire.&nbsp; But if you want
to see how it comes about, look here at this freshly-grubbed land&mdash;how
sour it is.&nbsp; You can see that by the colour of it&mdash;some black,
some red, some green, some yellow, all full of sour iron, which will
let nothing grow.&nbsp; After the chalk has been on it a year or two,
those colours will have all gone out of it; and it will turn to a nice
wholesome brown, like the rest of the field; and then you will know
that the land is sweet, and fit for any crop.&nbsp; Now do you mind
what I tell you, and then I&rsquo;ll tell you something more.&nbsp;
We put on the chalk because, beside sweetening the land, it will hold
water.&nbsp; You see, the land about here, though it is often very wet
from springs, is sandy and hungry; and when we drain the bottom water
out of it, the top water (that is, the rain) is apt to run through it
too fast: and then it dries and burns up; and we get no plant of wheat,
nor of turnips either.&nbsp; So we put on chalk to hold water, and keep
the ground moist.</p>
<p>But how can these lumps of chalk hold water?&nbsp; They are not made
like cups.</p>
<p>No: but they are made like sponges, which serves our turn better
still.&nbsp; Just take up that lump, young squire, and you&rsquo;ll
see water enough in it, or rather looking out of it, and staring you
in the face.</p>
<p>Why! one side of the lump is all over thick ice.</p>
<p>So it is.&nbsp; All that water was inside the chalk last night, till
it froze.&nbsp; And then it came squeezing out of the holes in the chalk
in strings, as you may see it if you break the ice across.&nbsp; Now
you may judge for yourself how much water a load of chalk will hold,
even on a dry summer&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; And now, if you&rsquo;ll excuse
me, sir, I must be off to market.</p>
<p>Was it all true that the farmer said?</p>
<p>Quite true, I believe.&nbsp; He is not a scientific man&mdash;that
is, he does not know the chemical causes of all these things; but his
knowledge is sound and useful, because it comes from long experience.&nbsp;
He and his forefathers, perhaps for a thousand years and more, have
been farming this country, reading Madam How&rsquo;s books with very
keen eyes, experimenting and watching, very carefully and rationally;
making mistakes often, and failing and losing their crops and their
money; but learning from their mistakes, till their empiric knowledge,
as it is called, helps them to grow sometimes quite as good crops as
if they had learned agricultural chemistry.</p>
<p>What he meant by the chalk sweetening the land you would not understand
yet, and I can hardly tell you; for chemists are not yet agreed how
it happens.&nbsp; But he was right; and right, too, what he told you
about the water inside the chalk, which is more important to us just
now; for, if we follow it out, we shall surely come to a cave at last.</p>
<p>So now for the water in the chalk.&nbsp; You can see now why the
chalk-downs at Winchester are always green, even in the hottest summer:
because Madam How has put under them her great chalk sponge.&nbsp; The
winter rains soak into it; and the summer heat draws that rain out of
it again as invisible steam, coming up from below, to keep the roots
of the turf cool and moist under the blazing sun.</p>
<p>You love that short turf well.&nbsp; You love to run and race over
the Downs with your butterfly-net and hunt &ldquo;chalk-hill blues,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;marbled whites,&rdquo; and &ldquo;spotted burnets,&rdquo;
till you are hot and tired; and then to sit down and look at the quiet
little old city below, with the long cathedral roof, and the tower of
St. Cross, and the gray old walls and buildings shrouded by noble trees,
all embosomed among the soft rounded lines of the chalk-hills; and then
you begin to feel very thirsty, and cry, &ldquo;Oh, if there were but
springs and brooks in the Downs, as there are at home!&rdquo;&nbsp;
But all the hollows are as dry as the hill tops.&nbsp; There is not
a brook, or the mark of a watercourse, in one of them.&nbsp; You are
like the Ancient Mariner in the poem, with</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Water, water, every where,<br />
Nor any drop to drink.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To get that you must go down and down, hundreds of feet, to the green
meadows through which silver Itchen glides toward the sea.&nbsp; There
you stand upon the bridge, and watch the trout in water so crystal-clear
that you see every weed and pebble as if you looked through air.&nbsp;
If ever there was pure water, you think, that is pure.&nbsp; Is it so?&nbsp;
Drink some.&nbsp; Wash your hands in it and try&mdash;You feel that
the water is rough, hard (as they call it), quite different from the
water at home, which feels as soft as velvet.&nbsp; What makes it so
hard?</p>
<p>Because it is full of invisible chalk.&nbsp; In every gallon of that
water there are, perhaps, fifteen grains of solid chalk, which was once
inside the heart of the hills above.&nbsp; Day and night, year after
year, the chalk goes down to the sea; and if there were such creatures
as water-fairies&mdash;if it were true, as the old Greeks and Romans
thought, that rivers were living things, with a Nymph who dwelt in each
of them, and was its goddess or its queen&mdash;then, if your ears were
opened to hear her, the Nymph of Itchen might say to you&mdash;</p>
<p>So child, you think that I do nothing but, as your sister says when
she sings Mr. Tennyson&rsquo;s beautiful song,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I chatter over stony ways,<br />
In little sharps and trebles,<br />
I bubble into eddying bays,<br />
I babble on the pebbles.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; I do that: and I love, as the Nymphs loved of old, men
who have eyes to see my beauty, and ears to discern my song, and to
fit their own song to it, and tell how</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I wind about, and in and out,<br />
With here a blossom sailing,<br />
And here and there a lusty trout,<br />
And here and there a grayling,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And here and there a foamy flake<br />
Upon me, as I travel<br />
With many a silvery waterbreak<br />
Above the golden gravel,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And draw them all along, and flow<br />
To join the brimming river,<br />
For men may come and men may go,<br />
But I go on for ever.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; That is all true: but if that were all, I should not be
let to flow on for ever, in a world where Lady Why rules, and Madam
How obeys.&nbsp; I only exist (like everything else, from the sun in
heaven to the gnat which dances in his beam) on condition of working,
whether we wish it or not, whether we know it or not.&nbsp; I am not
an idle stream, only fit to chatter to those who bathe or fish in my
waters, or even to give poets beautiful fancies about me.&nbsp; You
little guess the work I do.&nbsp; For I am one of the daughters of Madam
How, and, like her, work night and day, we know not why, though Lady
Why must know.&nbsp; So day by day, and night by night, while you are
sleeping (for I never sleep), I carry, delicate and soft as I am, a
burden which giants could not bear: and yet I am never tired.&nbsp;
Every drop of rain which the south-west wind brings from the West Indian
seas gives me fresh life and strength to bear my burden; and it has
need to do so; for every drop of rain lays a fresh burden on me.&nbsp;
Every root and weed which grows in every field; every dead leaf which
falls in the highwoods of many a parish, from the Grange and Woodmancote
round to Farleigh and Preston, and so to Brighton and the Alresford
downs;&mdash;ay, every atom of manure which the farmers put on the land&mdash;foul
enough then, but pure enough before it touches me&mdash;each of these,
giving off a tiny atom of what men call carbonic acid, melts a tiny
grain of chalk, and helps to send it down through the solid hill by
one of the million pores and veins which at once feed and burden my
springs.&nbsp; Ages on ages I have worked on thus, carrying the chalk
into the sea.&nbsp; And ages on ages, it may be, I shall work on yet;
till I have done my work at last, and levelled the high downs into a
flat sea-shore, with beds of flint gravel rattling in the shallow waves.</p>
<p>She might tell you that; and when she had told you, you would surely
think of the clumsy chalk-cart rumbling down the hill, and then of the
graceful stream, bearing silently its invisible load of chalk; and see
how much more delicate and beautiful, as well as vast and wonderful,
Madam How&rsquo;s work is than that of man.</p>
<p>But if you asked the nymph why she worked on for ever, she could
not tell you.&nbsp; For like the Nymphs of old, and the Hamadryads who
lived, in trees, and Undine, and the little Sea-maiden, she would have
no soul; no reason; no power to say why.</p>
<p>It is for you, who are a reasonable being, to guess why: or at least
listen to me if I guess for you, and say, perhaps&mdash;I can only say
perhaps&mdash;that chalk may be going to make layers of rich marl in
the sea between England and France; and those marl-beds may be upheaved
and grow into dry land, and be ploughed, and sowed, and reaped by a
wiser race of men, in a better-ordered world than this: or the chalk
may have even a nobler destiny before it.&nbsp; That may happen to it,
which has happened already to many a grain of lime.&nbsp; It may be
carried thousands of miles away to help in building up a coral reef
(what that is I must tell you afterwards).&nbsp; That coral reef may
harden into limestone beds.&nbsp; Those beds may be covered up, pressed,
and, it may be, heated, till they crystallise into white marble: and
out of it fairer statues be carved, and grander temples built, than
the world has ever yet seen.</p>
<p>And if that is not the reason why the chalk is being sent into the
sea, then there is another reason, and probably a far better one.&nbsp;
For, as I told you at first, Lady Why&rsquo;s intentions are far wiser
and better than our fancies; and she&mdash;like Him whom she obeys&mdash;is
able to do exceeding abundantly, beyond all that we can ask or think.</p>
<p>But you will say now that we have followed the chalk-cart a long
way, without coming to the cave.</p>
<p>You are wrong.&nbsp; We have come to the very mouth of the cave.&nbsp;
All we have to do is to say&mdash;not &ldquo;Open Sesame,&rdquo; like
Ali Baba in the tale of the Forty Thieves&mdash;but some word or two
which Madam Why will teach us, and forthwith a hill will open, and we
shall walk in, and behold rivers and cascades underground, stalactite
pillars and stalagmite statues, and all the wonders of the grottoes
of Adelsberg, Antiparos, or Kentucky.</p>
<p>Am I joking?&nbsp; Yes, and yet no; for you know that when I joke
I am usually most in earnest.&nbsp; At least, I am now.</p>
<p>But there are no caves in chalk?</p>
<p>No, not that I ever heard of.&nbsp; There are, though, in limestone,
which is only a harder kind of chalk.&nbsp; Madam How could turn this
chalk into hard limestone, I believe, even now; and in more ways than
one: but in ways which would not be very comfortable or profitable for
us Southern folk who live on it.&nbsp; I am afraid that&mdash;what between
squeezing and heating&mdash;she would flatten us all out into phosphatic
fossils, about an inch thick; and turn Winchester city into a &ldquo;breccia&rdquo;
which would puzzle geologists a hundred thousand years hence.&nbsp;
So we will hope that she will leave our chalk downs for the Itchen to
wash gently away, while we talk about caves, and how Madam How scoops
them out by water underground, just in the same way, only more roughly,
as she melts the chalk.</p>
<p>Suppose, then, that these hills, instead of being soft, spongy chalk,
were all hard limestone marble, like that of which the font in the church
is made.&nbsp; Then the rainwater, instead of sinking through the chalk
as now, would run over the ground down-hill, and if it came to a crack
(a fault, as it is called) it would run down between the rock; and as
it ran it would eat that hole wider and wider year by year, and make
a swallow-hole&mdash;such as you may see in plenty if you ever go up
Whernside, or any of the high hills in Yorkshire&mdash;unfathomable
pits in the green turf, in which you may hear the water tinkling and
trickling far, far underground.</p>
<p>And now, before we go a step farther, you may understand, why the
bones of animals are so often found in limestone caves.&nbsp; Down such
swallow-holes how many beasts must fall: either in hurry and fright,
when hunted by lions and bears and such cruel beasts; or more often
still in time of snow, when the holes are covered with drift; or, again,
if they died on the open hill-sides, their bones might be washed in,
in floods, along with mud and stones, and buried with them in the cave
below; and beside that, lions and bears and hy&aelig;nas might live
in the caves below, as we know they did in some caves, and drag in bones
through the caves&rsquo; mouths; or, again, savages might live in that
cave, and bring in animals to eat, like the wild beasts; and so those
bones might be mixed up, as we know they were, with things which the
savages had left behind&mdash;like flint tools or beads; and then the
whole would be hardened, by the dripping of the limestone water, into
a paste of breccia just like this in my drawer.&nbsp; But the bones
of the savages themselves you would seldom or never find mixed in it&mdash;unless
some one had fallen in by accident from above.&nbsp; And why?&nbsp;
(For there is a Why? to that question: and not merely a How?)&nbsp;
Simply because they were men; and because God has put into the hearts
of all men, even of the lowest savages, some sort of reverence for those
who are gone; and has taught them to bury, or in some other way take
care of, their bones.</p>
<p>But how is the swallow-hole sure to end in a cave?</p>
<p>Because it cannot help making a cave for itself if it has time.</p>
<p>Think: and you will see that it must be so.&nbsp; For that water
must run somewhere; and so it eats its way out between the beds of the
rock, making underground galleries, and at last caves and lofty halls.&nbsp;
For it always eats, remember, at the bottom of its channel, leaving
the roof alone.&nbsp; So it eats, and eats, more in some places and
less in others, according as the stone is harder or softer, and according
to the different direction of the rock-beds (what we call their dip
and strike); till at last it makes one of those wonderful caverns about
which you are so fond of reading&mdash;such a cave as there actually
is in the rocks of the mountain of Whernside, fed by the swallow-holes
around the mountain-top; a cave hundreds of yards long, with halls,
and lakes, and waterfalls, and curtains and festoons of stalactite which
have dripped from the roof, and pillars of stalagmite which have been
built up on the floor below.&nbsp; These stalactites (those tell me
who have seen them) are among the most beautiful of all Madam How&rsquo;s
work; sometimes like branches of roses or of grapes; sometimes like
statues; sometimes like delicate curtains, and I know not what other
beautiful shapes.&nbsp; I have never seen them, I am sorry to say, and
therefore I cannot describe them.&nbsp; But they are all made in the
same way; just in the same way as those little straight stalactites
which you may have seen hanging, like icicles, in vaulted cellars, or
under the arches of a bridge.&nbsp; The water melts more lime than it
can carry, and drops some of it again, making fresh limestone grain
by grain as it drips from the roof above; and fresh limestone again
where it splashes on the floor below: till if it dripped long enough,
the stalactite hanging from above would meet the stalagmite rising from
below, and join in one straight round white graceful shaft, which would
seem (but only seem) to support the roof of the cave.&nbsp; And out
of that cave&mdash;though not always out of the mouth of it&mdash;will
run a stream of water, which seems to you clear as crystal, though it
is actually, like the Itchen at Winchester, full of lime; so full of
lime, that it makes beds of fresh limestone, which are called travertine&mdash;which
you may see in Italy, and Greece, and Asia Minor: or perhaps it petrifies,
as you call it, the weeds in its bed, like that dropping-well at Knaresborough,
of which you have often seen a picture.&nbsp; And the cause is this:
the water is so full of lime, that it is forced to throw away some of
it upon everything it touches, and so incrusts with stone&mdash;though
it does not turn to stone&mdash;almost anything you put in it.&nbsp;
You have seen, or ought to have seen, petrified moss and birds&rsquo;
nests and such things from Knaresborough Well: and now you know a little,
though only a very little, of how the pretty toys are made.</p>
<p>Now if you can imagine for yourself (though I suppose a little boy
cannot) the amount of lime which one of these subterranean rivers would
carry away, gnawing underground centuries after centuries, day and night,
summer and winter, then you will not be surprised at the enormous size
of caverns which may be seen in different parts of the world&mdash;but
always, I believe, in limestone rock.&nbsp; You would not be surprised
(though you would admire them) at the caverns of Adelsberg, in Carniola
(in the south of Austria, near the top of the Adriatic), which runs,
I believe, for miles in length; and in the lakes of which, in darkness
from its birth until its death, lives that strange beast, the Proteus
a sort of long newt which never comes to perfection&mdash;I suppose
for want of the genial sunlight which makes all things grow.&nbsp; But
he is blind; and more, he keeps all his life the same feathery gills
which newts have when they are babies, and which we have so often looked
at through the microscope, to see the blood-globules run round and round
inside.&nbsp; You would not wonder, either, at the Czirknitz Lake, near
the same place, which at certain times of the year vanishes suddenly
through chasms under water, sucking the fish down with it; and after
a certain time boils suddenly up again from the depths, bringing back
with it the fish, who have been swimming comfortably all the time in
a subterranean lake; and bringing back, too (and, extraordinary as this
story is, there is good reason to believe it true), live wild ducks
who went down small and unfledged, and come back full-grown and fat,
with water-weeds and small fish in their stomachs, showing they have
had plenty to feed on underground.&nbsp; But&mdash;and this is the strangest
part of the story, if true&mdash;they come up unfledged just as they
went down, and are moreover blind from having been so long in darkness.&nbsp;
After a while, however, folks say their eyes get right, their feathers
grow, and they fly away like other birds.</p>
<p>Neither would you be surprised (if you recollect that Madam How is
a very old lady indeed, and that some of her work is very old likewise)
at that Mammoth Cave in Kentucky, the largest cave in the known world,
through which you may walk nearly ten miles on end, and in which a hundred
miles of gallery have been explored already, and yet no end found to
the cave.&nbsp; In it (the guides will tell you) there are &ldquo;226
avenues, 47 domes, 8 cataracts, 23 pits, and several rivers;&rdquo;
and if that fact is not very interesting to you (as it certainly is
not to me) I will tell you something which ought to interest you: that
this cave is so immensely old that various kinds of little animals,
who have settled themselves in the outer parts of it, have had time
to change their shape, and to become quite blind; so that blind fathers
and mothers have blind children, generation after generation.</p>
<p>There are blind rats there, with large shining eyes which cannot
see&mdash;blind landcrabs, who have the foot-stalks of their eyes (you
may see them in any crab) still left; but the eyes which should be on
the top of them are gone.&nbsp; There are blind fish, too, in the cave,
and blind insects; for, if they have no use for their eyes in the dark,
why should Madam How take the trouble to finish them off?</p>
<p>One more cave I must tell you of, to show you how old some caves
must be, and then I must stop; and that is the cave of Carip&eacute;,
in Venezuela, which is the most northerly part of South America.&nbsp;
There, in the face of a limestone cliff, crested with enormous flowering
trees, and festooned with those lovely creepers of which you have seen
a few small ones in hothouses, there opens an arch as big as the west
front of Winchester Cathedral, and runs straight in like a cathedral
nave for more than 1400 feet.&nbsp; Out of it runs a stream; and along
the banks of that stream, as far as the sunlight strikes in, grow wild
bananas, and palms, and lords and ladies (as you call them), which are
not, like ours, one foot, but many feet high.&nbsp; Beyond that the
cave goes on, with subterranean streams, cascades, and halls, no man
yet knows how far.&nbsp; A friend of mine last year went in farther,
I believe, than any one yet has gone; but, instead of taking Indian
torches made of bark and resin, or even torches made of Spanish wax,
such as a brave bishop of those parts used once when he went in farther
than any one before him, he took with him some of that beautiful magnesium
light which you have seen often here at home.&nbsp; And in one place,
when he lighted up the magnesium, he found himself in a hall full 300
feet high&mdash;higher far, that is, than the dome of St. Paul&rsquo;s&mdash;and
a very solemn thought it was to him, he said, that he had seen what
no other human being ever had seen; and that no ray of light had ever
struck on that stupendous roof in all the ages since the making of the
world.&nbsp; But if he found out something which he did not expect,
he was disappointed in something which he did expect.&nbsp; For the
Indians warned him of a hole in the floor which (they told him) was
an unfathomable abyss.&nbsp; And lo and behold, when he turned the magnesium
light upon it, the said abyss was just about eight feet deep.&nbsp;
But it is no wonder that the poor Indians with their little smoky torches
should make such mistakes; no wonder, too, that they should be afraid
to enter far into those gloomy vaults; that they should believe that
the souls of their ancestors live in that dark cave; and that they should
say that when they die they will go to the Guacharos, as they call the
birds that fly with doleful screams out of the cave to feed at night,
and in again at daylight, to roost and sleep.</p>
<p>Now, it is these very Guacharo birds which are to me the most wonderful
part of the story.&nbsp; The Indians kill and eat them for their fat,
although they believe they have to do with evil spirits.&nbsp; But scientific
men who have studied these birds will tell you that they are more wonderful
than if all the Indians&rsquo; fancies about them were true.&nbsp; They
are great birds, more than three feet across the wings, somewhat like
owls, somewhat like cuckoos, somewhat like goatsuckers; but, on the
whole, unlike anything in the world but themselves; and instead of feeding
on moths or mice, they feed upon hard dry fruits, which they pick off
the trees after the set of sun.&nbsp; And wise men will tell you, that
in making such a bird as that, and giving it that peculiar way of life,
and settling it in that cavern, and a few more caverns in that part
of the world, and therefore in making the caverns ready for them to
live in, Madam How must have taken ages and ages, more than you can
imagine or count.</p>
<p>But that is among the harder lessons which come in the latter part
of Madam How&rsquo;s book.&nbsp; Children need not learn them yet; and
they can never learn them, unless they master her alphabet, and her
short and easy lessons for beginners, some of which I am trying to teach
you now.</p>
<p>But I have just recollected that we are a couple of very stupid fellows.&nbsp;
We have been talking all this time about chalk and limestone, and have
forgotten to settle what they are, and how they were made.&nbsp; We
must think of that next time.&nbsp; It will not do for us (at least
if we mean to be scientific men) to use terms without defining them;
in plain English, to talk about&mdash;we don&rsquo;t know what.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;MADAM HOW&rsquo;S TWO GRANDSONS</h2>
<p>You want to know, then, what chalk is?&nbsp; I suppose you mean what
chalk is made of?</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; That is it.</p>
<p>That we can only help by calling in the help of a very great giant
whose name is Analysis.</p>
<p>A giant?</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; And before we call for him I will tell you a very curious
story about him and his younger brother, which is every word of it true.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, certainly as long ago as the first man, or perhaps
the first rational being of any kind, was created, Madam How had two
grandsons.&nbsp; The elder is called Analysis, and the younger Synthesis.&nbsp;
As for who their father and mother were, there have been so many disputes
on that question that I think children may leave it alone for the present.&nbsp;
For my part, I believe that they are both, like St. Patrick, &ldquo;gentlemen,
and come of decent people;&rdquo; and I have a great respect and affection
for them both, as long as each keeps in his own place and minds his
own business.</p>
<p>Now you must understand that, as soon as these two baby giants were
born, Lady Why, who sets everything to do that work for which it is
exactly fitted, set both of them their work.&nbsp; Analysis was to take
to pieces everything he found, and find out how it was made.&nbsp; Synthesis
was to put the pieces together again, and make something fresh out of
them.&nbsp; In a word, Analysis was to teach men Science; and Synthesis
to teach them Art.</p>
<p>But because Analysis was the elder, Madam How commanded Synthesis
never to put the pieces together till Analysis had taken them completely
apart.&nbsp; And, my child, if Synthesis had obeyed that rule of his
good old grandmother&rsquo;s, the world would have been far happier,
wealthier, wiser, and better than it is now.</p>
<p>But Synthesis would not.&nbsp; He grew up a very noble boy.&nbsp;
He could carve, he could paint, he could build, he could make music,
and write poems: but he was full of conceit and haste.&nbsp; Whenever
his elder brother tried to do a little patient work in taking things
to pieces, Synthesis snatched the work out of his hands before it was
a quarter done, and began putting it together again to suit his own
fancy, and, of course, put it together wrong.&nbsp; Then he went on
to bully his elder brother, and locked him up in prison, and starved
him, till for many hundred years poor Analysis never grew at all, but
remained dwarfed, and stupid, and all but blind for want of light; while
Synthesis, and all the hasty conceited people who followed him, grew
stout and strong and tyrannous, and overspread the whole world, and
ruled it at their will.&nbsp; But the fault of all the work of Synthesis
was just this: that it would not work.&nbsp; His watches would not keep
time, his soldiers would not fight, his ships would not sail, his houses
would not keep the rain out.&nbsp; So every time he failed in his work
he had to go to poor Analysis in his dungeon, and bully him into taking
a thing or two to pieces, and giving him a few sound facts out of them,
just to go on with till he came to grief again, boasting in the meantime
that he and not Analysis had found out the facts.&nbsp; And at last
he grew so conceited that he fancied he knew all that Madam How could
teach him, or Lady Why either, and that he understood all things in
heaven and earth; while it was not the real heaven and earth that he
was thinking of, but a sham heaven and a sham earth, which he had built
up out of his guesses and his own fancies.</p>
<p>And the more Synthesis waxed in pride, and the more he trampled upon
his poor brother, the more reckless he grew, and the more willing to
deceive himself.&nbsp; If his real flowers would not grow, he cut out
paper flowers, and painted them and said that they would do just as
well as natural ones.&nbsp; If his dolls would not work, he put strings
and wires behind them to make them nod their heads and open their eyes,
and then persuaded other people, and perhaps half-persuaded himself,
that they were alive.&nbsp; If the hand of his weather-glass went down,
he nailed it up to insure a fine day, and tortured, burnt, or murdered
every one who said it did not keep up of itself.&nbsp; And many other
foolish and wicked things he did, which little boys need not hear of
yet.</p>
<p>But at last his punishment came, according to the laws of his grandmother,
Madam How, which are like the laws of the Medes and Persians, and alter
not, as you and all mankind will sooner or later find; for he grew so
rich and powerful that he grew careless and lazy, and thought about
nothing but eating and drinking, till people began to despise him more
and more.&nbsp; And one day he left the dungeon of Analysis so ill guarded,
that Analysis got out and ran away.&nbsp; Great was the hue and cry
after him; and terribly would he have been punished had he been caught.&nbsp;
But, lo and behold, folks had grown so disgusted with Synthesis that
they began to take the part of Analysis.&nbsp; Poor men hid him in their
cottages, and scholars in their studies.&nbsp; And when war arose about
him,&mdash;and terrible wars did arise,&mdash;good kings, wise statesmen,
gallant soldiers, spent their treasure and their lives in fighting for
him.&nbsp; All honest folk welcomed him, because he was honest; and
all wise folk used him, for, instead of being a conceited tyrant like
Synthesis, he showed himself the most faithful, diligent, humble of
servants, ready to do every man&rsquo;s work, and answer every man&rsquo;s
questions.&nbsp; And among them all he got so well fed that he grew
very shortly into the giant that he ought to have been all along; and
was, and will be for many a year to come, perfectly able to take care
of himself.</p>
<p>As for poor Synthesis, he really has fallen so low in these days,
that one cannot but pity him.&nbsp; He now goes about humbly after his
brother, feeding on any scraps that are thrown to him, and is snubbed
and rapped over the knuckles, and told one minute to hold his tongue
and mind his own business, and the next that he has no business at all
to mind, till he has got into such a poor way that some folks fancy
he will die, and are actually digging his grave already, and composing
his epitaph.&nbsp; But they are trying to wear the bear&rsquo;s skin
before the bear is killed; for Synthesis is not dead, nor anything like
it; and he will rise up again some day, to make good friends with his
brother Analysis, and by his help do nobler and more beautiful work
than he has ever yet done in the world.</p>
<p>So now Analysis has got the upper hand; so much so that he is in
danger of being spoilt by too much prosperity, as his brother was before
him; in which case he too will have his fall; and a great deal of good
it will do him.&nbsp; And that is the end of my story, and a true story
it is.</p>
<p>Now you must remember, whenever you have to do with him, that Analysis,
like fire, is a very good servant, but a very bad master.&nbsp; For,
having got his freedom only of late years or so, he is, like young men
when they come suddenly to be their own masters, apt to be conceited,
and to fancy that he knows everything, when really he knows nothing,
and can never know anything, but only knows about things, which is a
very different matter.&nbsp; Indeed, nowadays he pretends that he can
teach his old grandmother, Madam How, not only how to suck eggs, but
to make eggs into the bargain; while the good old lady just laughs at
him kindly, and lets him run on, because she knows he will grow wiser
in time, and learn humility by his mistakes and failures, as I hope
you will from yours.</p>
<p>However, Analysis is a very clever young giant, and can do wonderful
work as long as he meddles only with dead things, like this bit of lime.&nbsp;
He can take it to pieces, and tell you of what things it is made, or
seems to be made; and take them to pieces again, and tell you what each
of them is made of; and so on, till he gets conceited, and fancies that
he can find out some one Thing of all things (which he calls matter),
of which all other things are made; and some Way of all ways (which
he calls force), by which all things are made: but when he boasts in
that way, old Madam How smiles, and says, &ldquo;My child, before you
can say that, you must remember a hundred things which you are forgetting,
and learn a hundred thousand things which you do not know;&rdquo; and
then she just puts her hand over his eyes, and Master Analysis begins
groping in the dark, and talking the saddest nonsense.&nbsp; So beware
of him, and keep him in his own place, and to his own work, or he will
flatter you, and get the mastery of you, and persuade you that he can
teach you a thousand things of which he knows no more than he does why
a duck&rsquo;s egg never hatches into a chicken.&nbsp; And remember,
if Master Analysis ever grows saucy and conceited with you, just ask
him that last riddle, and you will shut him up at once.</p>
<p>And why?</p>
<p>Because Analysis can only explain to you a little about dead things,
like stones&mdash;inorganic things as they are called.&nbsp; Living
things&mdash;organisms, as they are called&mdash;he cannot explain to
you at all.&nbsp; When he meddles with them, he always ends like the
man who killed his goose to get the golden eggs.&nbsp; He has to kill
his goose, or his flower, or his insect, before he can analyse it; and
then it is not a goose, but only the corpse of a goose; not a flower,
but only the dead stuff of the flower.</p>
<p>And therefore he will never do anything but fail, when he tries to
find out the life in things.&nbsp; How can he, when he has to take the
life out of them first?&nbsp; He could not even find out how a plum-pudding
is made by merely analysing it.&nbsp; He might part the sugar, and the
flour, and the suet; he might even (for he is very clever, and very
patient too, the more honour to him) take every atom of sugar out of
the flour with which it had got mixed, and every atom of brown colour
which had got out of the plums and currants into the body of the pudding,
and then, for aught I know, put the colouring matter back again into
the plums and currants; and then, for aught I know, turn the boiled
pudding into a raw one again,&mdash;for he is a great conjurer, as Madam
How&rsquo;s grandson is bound to be: but yet he would never find out
how the pudding was made, unless some one told him the great secret
which the sailors in the old story forgot&mdash;that the cook boiled
it in a cloth.</p>
<p>This is Analysis&rsquo;s weak point&mdash;don&rsquo;t let it be yours&mdash;that
in all his calculations he is apt to forget the cloth, and indeed the
cook likewise.&nbsp; No doubt he can analyse the matter of things: but
he will keep forgetting that he cannot analyse their form.</p>
<p>Do I mean their shape?</p>
<p>No, my child; no.&nbsp; I mean something which makes the shape of
things, and the matter of them likewise, but which folks have lost sight
of nowadays, and do not seem likely to get sight of again for a few
hundred years.&nbsp; So I suppose that you need not trouble your head
about it, but may just follow the fashions as long as they last.</p>
<p>About this piece of lime, however, Analysis can tell us a great deal.&nbsp;
And we may trust what he says, and believe that he understands what
he says.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Think now.&nbsp; If you took your watch to pieces, you would probably
spoil it for ever; you would have perhaps broken, and certainly mislaid,
some of the bits; and not even a watchmaker could put it together again.&nbsp;
You would have analysed the watch wrongly.&nbsp; But if a watchmaker
took it to pieces then any other watchmaker could put it together again
to go as well as ever, because they both understand the works, how they
fit into each other, and what the use and the power of each is.&nbsp;
Its being put together again rightly would be a proof that it had been
taken to pieces rightly.</p>
<p>And so with Master Analysis.&nbsp; If he can take a thing to pieces
so that his brother Synthesis can put it together again, you may be
sure that he has done his work rightly.</p>
<p>Now he can take a bit of chalk to pieces, so that it shall become
several different things, none of which is chalk, or like chalk at all.&nbsp;
And then his brother Synthesis can put them together again, so that
they shall become chalk, as they were before.&nbsp; He can do that very
nearly, but not quite.&nbsp; There is, in every average piece of chalk,
something which he cannot make into chalk again when he has once unmade
it.</p>
<p>What that is I will show you presently; and a wonderful tale hangs
thereby.&nbsp; But first we will let Analysis tell us what chalk is
made of, as far as he knows.</p>
<p>He will say&mdash;Chalk is carbonate of lime.</p>
<p>But what is carbonate of lime made of?</p>
<p>Lime and carbonic acid.</p>
<p>And what is lime?</p>
<p>The oxide of a certain metal, called calcium.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>That quicklime is a certain metal mixed with oxygen gas; and slacked
lime is the same, mixed with water.</p>
<p>So lime is a metal.&nbsp; What is a metal?&nbsp; Nobody knows.</p>
<p>And what is oxygen gas?&nbsp; Nobody knows.</p>
<p>Well, Analysis, stops short very soon.&nbsp; He does not seem to
know much about the matter.</p>
<p>Nay, nay, you are wrong there.&nbsp; It is just &ldquo;about the
matter&rdquo; that he does know, and knows a great deal, and very accurately;
what he does not know is the matter itself.&nbsp; He will tell you wonderful
things about oxygen gas&mdash;how the air is full of it, the water full
of it, every living thing full of it; how it changes hard bright steel
into soft, foul rust; how a candle cannot burn without it, or you live
without it.&nbsp; But what it is he knows not.</p>
<p>Will he ever know?</p>
<p>That is Lady Why&rsquo;s concern, and not ours.&nbsp; Meanwhile he
has a right to find out if he can.&nbsp; But what do you want to ask
him next?</p>
<p>What?&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; What carbonic acid is.&nbsp; He can tell you
that.&nbsp; Carbon and oxygen gas.</p>
<p>But what is carbon?</p>
<p>Nobody knows.</p>
<p>Why, here is this stupid Analysis at fault again.</p>
<p>Nay, nay, again.&nbsp; Be patient with him.&nbsp; If he cannot tell
you what carbon is, he can tell you what is carbon, which is well worth
knowing.&nbsp; He will tell you, for instance, that every time you breathe
or speak, what comes out of your mouth is carbonic acid; and that, if
your breath comes on a bit of slacked lime, it will begin to turn it
back into the chalk from which it was made; and that, if your breath
comes on the leaves of a growing plant, that leaf will take the carbon
out of it, and turn it into wood.&nbsp; And surely that is worth knowing,&mdash;that
you may be helping to make chalk, or to make wood, every time you breathe.</p>
<p>Well; that is very curious.</p>
<p>But now, ask him, What is carbon?&nbsp; And he will tell you, that
many things are carbon.&nbsp; A diamond is carbon; and so is blacklead;
and so is charcoal and coke, and coal in part, and wood in part.</p>
<p>What?&nbsp; Does Analysis say that a diamond and charcoal are the
same thing?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Then his way of taking things to pieces must be a very clumsy one,
if he can find out no difference between diamond and charcoal.</p>
<p>Well, perhaps it is: but you must remember that, though he is very
old&mdash;as old as the first man who ever lived&mdash;he has only been
at school for the last three hundred years or so.&nbsp; And remember,
too, that he is not like you, who have some one else to teach you.&nbsp;
He has had to teach himself, and find out for himself, and make his
own tools, and work in the dark besides.&nbsp; And I think it is very
much to his credit that he ever found out that diamond and charcoal
were the same things.&nbsp; You would never have found it out for yourself,
you will agree.</p>
<p>No: but how did he do it?</p>
<p>He taught a very famous chemist, Lavoisier, about ninety years ago,
how to burn a diamond in oxygen&mdash;and a very difficult trick that
is; and Lavoisier found that the diamond when burnt turned almost entirely
into carbonic acid and water, as blacklead and charcoal do; and more,
that each of them turned into the same quantity of carbonic acid, And
so he knew, as surely as man can know anything, that all these things,
however different to our eyes and fingers, are really made of the same
thing,&mdash;pure carbon.</p>
<p>But what makes them look and feel so different?</p>
<p>That Analysis does not know yet.&nbsp; Perhaps he will find out some
day; for he is very patient, and very diligent, as you ought to be.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, be content with him: remember that though he cannot see through
a milestone yet, he can see farther into one than his neighbours.&nbsp;
Indeed his neighbours cannot see into a milestone at all, but only see
the outside of it, and know things only by rote, like parrots, without
understanding what they mean and how they are made.</p>
<p>So now remember that chalk is carbonate of lime, and that it is made
up of three things, calcium, oxygen, and carbon; and that therefore
its mark is CaCO(3), in Analysis&rsquo;s language, which I hope you
will be able to read some day.</p>
<p>But how is it that Analysis and Synthesis cannot take all this chalk
to pieces, and put it together again?</p>
<p>Look here; what is that in the chalk?</p>
<p>Oh! a shepherd&rsquo;s crown, such as we often find in the gravel,
only fresh and white.</p>
<p>Well; you know what that was once.&nbsp; I have often told you:&mdash;a
live sea-egg, covered with prickles, which crawls at the bottom of the
sea.</p>
<p>Well, I am sure that Master Synthesis could not put that together
again: and equally sure that Master Analysis might spend ages in taking
it to pieces, before he found out how it was made.&nbsp; And&mdash;we
are lucky to-day, for this lower chalk to the south has very few fossils
in it&mdash;here is something else which is not mere carbonate of lime.&nbsp;
Look at it.</p>
<p>A little cockle, something like a wrinkled hazel-nut.</p>
<p>No; that is no cockle.&nbsp; Madam How invented that ages and ages
before she thought of cockles, and the animal which lived inside that
shell was as different from a cockle-animal as a sparrow is from a dog.&nbsp;
That is a Terebratula, a gentleman of a very ancient and worn-out family.&nbsp;
He and his kin swarmed in the old seas, even as far back as the time
when the rocks of the Welsh mountains were soft mud; as you will know
when you read that great book of Sir Roderick Murchison&rsquo;s, <i>Siluria</i>.&nbsp;
But as the ages rolled on, they got fewer and fewer, these Terebratul&aelig;;
and now there are hardly any of them left; only six or seven sorts are
left about these islands, which cling to stones in deep water; and the
first time I dredged two of them out of Loch Fyne, I looked at them
with awe, as on relics from another world, which had lasted on through
unnumbered ages and changes, such as one&rsquo;s fancy could not grasp.</p>
<p>But you will agree that, if Master Analysis took that shell to pieces,
Master Synthesis would not be likely to put it together again; much
less to put it together in the right way, in which Madam How made it.</p>
<p>And what was that?</p>
<p>By making a living animal, which went on growing, that is, making
itself; and making, as it grew, its shell to live in.&nbsp; Synthesis
has not found out yet the first step towards doing that; and, as I believe,
he never will.</p>
<p>But there would be no harm in his trying?</p>
<p>Of course not.&nbsp; Let everybody try to do everything they fancy.&nbsp;
Even if they fail, they will have learnt at least that they cannot do
it.</p>
<p>But now&mdash;and this is a secret which you would never find out
for yourself, at least without the help of a microscope&mdash;the greater
part of this lump of chalk is made up of things which neither Analysis
can perfectly take to pieces, nor Synthesis put together again.&nbsp;
It is made of dead organisms, that is, things which have been made by
living creatures.&nbsp; If you washed and brushed that chalk into powder,
you would find it full of little things like the Dentalina in this drawing,
and many other curious forms.&nbsp; I will show you some under the microscope
one day.</p>
<p>They are the shells of animals called Foraminifera, because the shells
of some of them are full of holes, through which they put out tiny arms.&nbsp;
So small they are and so many, that there may be, it is said, forty
thousand of them in a bit of chalk an inch every way.&nbsp; In numbers
past counting, some whole, some broken, some ground to the finest powder,
they make up vast masses of England, which are now chalk downs; and
in some foreign countries they make up whole mountains.&nbsp; Part of
the building stone of the Great Pyramid in Egypt is composed, I am told,
entirely of them.</p>
<p>And how did they get into the chalk?</p>
<p>Ah!&nbsp; How indeed?&nbsp; Let us think.&nbsp; The chalk must have
been laid down at the bottom of a sea, because there are sea-shells
in it.&nbsp; Besides, we find little atomies exactly like these alive
now in many seas; and therefore it is fair to suppose these lived in
the sea also.</p>
<p>Besides, they were not washed into the chalk by any sudden flood.&nbsp;
The water in which they settled must have been quite still, or these
little delicate creatures would have been ground into powder&mdash;or
rather into paste.&nbsp; Therefore learned men soon made up their minds
that these things were laid down at the bottom of a deep sea, so deep
that neither wind, nor tide, nor currents could stir the everlasting
calm.</p>
<p>Ah! it is worth thinking over, for it shows how shrewd a giant Analysis
is, and how fast he works in these days, now that he has got free and
well fed;&mdash;worth thinking over, I say, how our notions about these
little atomies have changed during the last forty years.</p>
<p>We used to find them sometimes washed up among the sea-sand on the
wild Atlantic coast; and we were taught, in the days when old Dr. Turton
was writing his book on British shells at Bideford, to call them Nautili,
because their shells were like Nautilus shells.&nbsp; Men did not know
then that the animal which lives in them is no more like a Nautilus
animal than it is like a cow.</p>
<p>For a Nautilus, you must know, is made like a cuttlefish, with eyes,
and strong jaws for biting, and arms round them; and has a heart, and
gills, and a stomach; and is altogether a very well-made beast, and,
I suspect, a terrible tyrant to little fish and sea-slugs, just as the
cuttlefish is.&nbsp; But the creatures which live in these little shells
are about the least finished of Madam How&rsquo;s works.&nbsp; They
have neither mouth nor stomach, eyes nor limbs.&nbsp; They are mere
live bags full of jelly, which can take almost any shape they like,
and thrust out arms&mdash;or what serve for arms&mdash;through the holes
in their shells, and then contract them into themselves again, as this
Globigerina does.&nbsp; What they feed on, how they grow, how they make
their exquisitely-formed shells, whether, indeed, they are, strictly
speaking, animals or vegetables, Analysis has not yet found out.&nbsp;
But when you come to read about them, you will find that they, in their
own way, are just as wonderful and mysterious as a butterfly or a rose;
and just as necessary, likewise, to Madam How&rsquo;s work; for out
of them, as I told you, she makes whole sheets of down, whole ranges
of hills.</p>
<p>No one knew anything, I believe, about them, save that two or three
kinds of them were found in chalk, till a famous Frenchman, called D&rsquo;Orbigny,
just thirty years ago, told the world how he had found many beautiful
fresh kinds; and, more strange still, that some of these kinds were
still alive at the bottom of the Adriatic, and of the harbour of Alexandria,
in Egypt.</p>
<p>Then in 1841 a gentleman named Edward Forbes,&mdash;now with God&mdash;whose
name will be for ever dear to all who love science, and honour genius
and virtue,&mdash;found in the &AElig;gean Sea &ldquo;a bed of chalk,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;full of Foraminifera, and shells of Pteropods,&rdquo;
forming at the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>And what are Pteropods?</p>
<p>What you might call sea-moths (though they are not really moths),
which swim about on the surface of the water, while the right-whales
suck them in tens of thousands into the great whalebone net which fringes
their jaws.&nbsp; Here are drawings of them.&nbsp; 1. Limacina (on which
the whales feed); and 2. Hyalea, a lovely little thing in a glass shell,
which lives in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>But since then strange discoveries have been made, especially by
the naval officers who surveyed the bottom of the great Atlantic Ocean
before laying down the electric cable between Ireland and America.&nbsp;
And this is what they found:</p>
<p>That at the bottom of the Atlantic were vast plains of soft mud,
in some places 2500 fathoms (15,000 feet) deep; that is, as deep as
the Alps are high.&nbsp; And more: they found out, to their surprise,
that the oozy mud of the Atlantic floor was made up almost entirely
of just the same atomies as make up our chalk, especially globigerinas;
that, in fact, a vast bed of chalk was now forming at the bottom of
the Atlantic, with living shells and sea-animals of the most brilliant
colours crawling about on it in black darkness, and beds of sponges
growing out of it, just as the sponges grew at the bottom of the old
chalk ocean, and were all, generation after generation, turned into
flints.</p>
<p>And, for reasons which you will hardly understand, men are beginning
now to believe that the chalk has never ceased to be made, somewhere
or other, for many thousand years, ever since the Winchester Downs were
at the bottom of the sea: and that &ldquo;the Globigerina-mud is not
merely <i>a</i> chalk formation, but a continuation of <i>the</i> chalk
formation, so <i>that we may be said to be still living in the age of
Chalk</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1">{1}</a>&nbsp;
Ah, my little man, what would I not give to see you, before I die, add
one such thought as that to the sum of human knowledge!</p>
<p>So there the little creatures have been lying, making chalk out of
the lime in the sea-water, layer over layer, the young over the old,
the dead over the living, year after year, age after age&mdash;for how
long?</p>
<p>Who can tell?&nbsp; How deep the layer of new chalk at the bottom
of the Atlantic is, we can never know.&nbsp; But the layer of live atomies
on it is not an inch thick, probably not a tenth of an inch.&nbsp; And
if it grew a tenth of an inch a year, or even a whole inch, how many
years must it have taken to make the chalk of our downs, which is in
some parts 1300 feet thick?&nbsp; How many inches are there in 1300
feet?&nbsp; Do that sum, and judge for yourself.</p>
<p>One difference will be found between the chalk now forming at the
bottom of the ocean, if it ever become dry land, and the chalk on which
you tread on the downs.&nbsp; The new chalk will be full of the teeth
and bones of whales&mdash;warm-blooded creatures, who suckle their young
like cows, instead of laying eggs, like birds and fish.&nbsp; For there
were no whales in the old chalk ocean; but our modern oceans are full
of cachalots, porpoises, dolphins, swimming in shoals round any ship;
and their bones and teeth, and still more their ear-bones, will drop
to the bottom as they die, and be found, ages hence, in the mud which
the live atomies make, along with wrecks of mighty ships</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Great anchors, heaps of pearl,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and all that man has lost in the deep seas.&nbsp; And sadder fossils
yet, my child, will be scattered on those white plains:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To them the love of woman hath gone down,<br />
Dark roll their waves o&rsquo;er manhood&rsquo;s noble head.<br />
O&rsquo;er youth&rsquo;s bright locks, and beauty&rsquo;s flowing crown;<br />
Yet shall they hear a voice, &lsquo;Restore the dead.&rsquo;<br />
Earth shall reclaim her precious things from thee.<br />
Give back the dead, thou Sea!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX&mdash;THE CORAL-REEF</h2>
<p>Now you want to know what I meant when I talked of a bit of lime
going out to sea, and forming part of a coral island, and then of a
limestone rock, and then of a marble statue.&nbsp; Very good.&nbsp;
Then look at this stone.</p>
<p>What a curious stone!&nbsp; Did it come from any place near here?</p>
<p>No.&nbsp; It came from near Dudley, in Staffordshire, where the soils
are worlds on worlds older than they are here, though they were made
in the same way as these and all other soils.&nbsp; But you are not
listening to me.</p>
<p>Why, the stone is full of shells, and bits of coral; and what are
these wonderful things coiled and tangled together, like the snakes
in Medusa&rsquo;s hair in the picture?&nbsp; Are they snakes?</p>
<p>If they are, then they must be snakes who have all one head; for
see, they are joined together at their larger ends; and snakes which
are branched, too, which no snake ever was.</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; I suppose they are not snakes.&nbsp; And they grow out
of a flower, too; and it has a stalk, jointed, too, as plants sometimes
are; and as fishes&rsquo; backbones are too.&nbsp; Is it a petrified
plant or flower?</p>
<p>No; though I do not deny that it looks like one.&nbsp; The creature
most akin to it which you ever saw is a star-fish.</p>
<p>What! one of the red star-fishes which one finds on the beach?&nbsp;
Its arms are not branched.</p>
<p>No.&nbsp; But there are star-fishes with branched arms still in the
sea.&nbsp; You know that pretty book (and learned book, too), Forbes&rsquo;s
<i>British Star-fishes</i>?&nbsp; You like to look it through for the
sake of the vignettes,&mdash;the mermaid and her child playing in the
sea.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and the kind bogie who is piping while the sandstars dance;
and the other who is trying to pull out the star-fish which the oyster
has caught.</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; But do you recollect the drawing of the Medusa&rsquo;s
head, with its curling arms, branched again and again without end?&nbsp;
Here it is.&nbsp; No, you shall not look at the vignettes now.&nbsp;
We must mind business.&nbsp; Now look at this one; the Feather-star,
with arms almost like fern-fronds.&nbsp; And in foreign seas there are
many other branched star-fish beside.</p>
<p>But they have no stalks?</p>
<p>Do not be too sure of that.&nbsp; This very feather-star, soon after
it is born, grows a tiny stalk, by which it holds on to corallines and
sea-weeds; and it is not till afterwards that it breaks loose from that
stalk, and swims away freely into the wide water.&nbsp; And in foreign
seas there are several star-fish still who grow on stalks all their
lives, as this fossil one did.</p>
<p>How strange that a live animal should grow on a stalk, like a flower!</p>
<p>Not quite like a flower.&nbsp; A flower has roots, by which it feeds
in the soil.&nbsp; These things grow more like sea-weeds, which have
no roots, but only hold on to the rock by the foot of the stalk, as
a ship holds on by her anchor.&nbsp; But as for its being strange that
live animals should grow on stalks, if it be strange it is common enough,
like many far stranger things.&nbsp; For under the water are millions
on millions of creatures, spreading for miles on miles, building up
at last great reefs of rocks, and whole islands, which all grow rooted
first to the rock, like sea-weeds; and what is more, they grow, most
of them, from one common root, branching again and again, and every
branchlet bearing hundreds of living creatures, so that the whole creation
is at once one creature and many creatures.&nbsp; Do you not understand
me?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Then fancy to yourself a bush like that hawthorn bush, with numberless
blossoms, and every blossom on that bush a separate living thing, with
its own mouth, and arms, and stomach, budding and growing fresh live
branches and fresh live flowers, as fast as the old ones die: and then
you will see better what I mean.</p>
<p>How wonderful!</p>
<p>Yes; but not more wonderful than your finger, for it, too, is made
up of numberless living things.</p>
<p>My finger made of living things?</p>
<p>What else can it be?&nbsp; When you cut your finger, does not the
place heal?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>And what is healing but growing again?&nbsp; And how could the atoms
of your fingers grow, and make fresh skin, if they were not each of
them alive?&nbsp; There, I will not puzzle you with too much at once;
you will know more about all that some day.&nbsp; Only remember now,
that there is nothing wonderful in the world outside you but has its
counterpart of something just as wonderful, and perhaps more wonderful,
inside you.&nbsp; Man is the microcosm, the little world, said the philosophers
of old; and philosophers nowadays are beginning to see that their old
guess is actual fact and true.</p>
<p>But what are these curious sea-creatures called, which are animals,
yet grow like plants?</p>
<p>They have more names than I can tell you, or you remember.&nbsp;
Those which helped to make this bit of stone are called coral-insects:
but they are not really insects, and are no more like insects than you
are.&nbsp; Coral-polypes is the best name for them, because they have
arms round their mouths, something like a cuttlefish, which the ancients
called Polypus.&nbsp; But the animal which you have seen likest to most
of them is a sea-anemone.</p>
<p>Look now at this piece of fresh coral&mdash;for coral it is, though
not like the coral which your sister wears in her necklace.&nbsp; You
see it is full of pipes; in each of those pipes has lived what we will
call, for the time being, a tiny sea-anemone, joined on to his brothers
by some sort of flesh and skin; and all of them together have built
up, out of the lime in the sea-water, this common house, or rather town,
of lime.</p>
<p>But is it not strange and wonderful?</p>
<p>Of course it is: but so is everything when you begin to look into
it; and if I were to go on, and tell you what sort of young ones these
coral-polypes have, and what becomes of them, you would hear such wonders,
that you would be ready to suspect that I was inventing nonsense, or
talking in my dreams.&nbsp; But all that belongs to Madam How&rsquo;s
deepest book of all, which is called the BOOK OF KIND: the book which
children cannot understand, and in which only the very wisest men are
able to spell out a few words, not knowing, and of course not daring
to guess, what wonder may come next.</p>
<p>Now we will go back to our stone, and talk about how it was made,
and how the stalked star-fish, which you mistook for a flower, ever
got into the stone.</p>
<p>Then do you think me silly for fancying that a fossil star-fish was
a flower?</p>
<p>I should be silly if I did.&nbsp; There is no silliness in not knowing
what you cannot know.&nbsp; You can only guess about new things, which
you have never seen before, by comparing them with old things, which
you have seen before; and you had seen flowers, and snakes, and fishes&rsquo;
backbones, and made a very fair guess from them.&nbsp; After all, some
of these stalked star-fish are so like flowers, lilies especially, that
they are called Encrinites; and the whole family is called Crinoids,
or lily-like creatures, from the Greek work <i>krinon</i>, a lily; and
as for corals and corallines, learned men, in spite of all their care
and shrewdness, made mistake after mistake about them, which they had
to correct again and again, till now, I trust, they have got at something
very like the truth.&nbsp; No, I shall only call you silly if you do
what some little boys are apt to do&mdash;call other boys, and, still
worse, servants or poor people, silly for not knowing what they cannot
know.</p>
<p>But are not poor people often very silly about animals and plants?&nbsp;
The boys at the village school say that slowworms are poisonous; is
not that silly?</p>
<p>Not at all.&nbsp; They know that adders bite, and so they think that
slowworms bite too.&nbsp; They are wrong; and they must be told that
they are wrong, and scolded if they kill a slowworm.&nbsp; But silly
they are not.</p>
<p>But is it not silly to fancy that swallows sleep all the winter at
the bottom of the pond?</p>
<p>I do not think so.&nbsp; The boys cannot know where the swallows
go; and if you told them&mdash;what is true&mdash;that the swallows
find their way every autumn through France, through Spain, over the
Straits of Gibraltar, into Morocco, and some, I believe, over the great
desert of Zahara into Negroland: and if you told them&mdash;what is
true also&mdash;that the young swallows actually find their way into
Africa without having been along the road before; because the old swallows
go south a week or two first, and leave the young ones to guess out
the way for themselves: if you told them that, then they would have
a right to say, &ldquo;Do you expect us to believe that?&nbsp; That
is much more wonderful than that the swallows should sleep in the pond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But is it?</p>
<p>Yes; to them.&nbsp; They know that bats and dormice and other things
sleep all the winter; so why should not swallows sleep?&nbsp; They see
the swallows about the water, and often dipping almost into it.&nbsp;
They know that fishes live under water, and that many insects&mdash;like
May-flies and caddis-flies and water-beetles&mdash;live sometimes in
the water, sometimes in the open air; and they cannot know&mdash;you
do not know&mdash;what it is which prevents a bird&rsquo;s living under
water.&nbsp; So their guess is really a very fair one; no more silly
than that of the savages, who when they first saw the white men&rsquo;s
ships, with their huge sails, fancied they were enormous sea-birds;
and when they heard the cannons fire, said that the ships spoke in thunder
and lightning.&nbsp; Their guess was wrong, but not silly; for it was
the best guess they could make.</p>
<p>But I do know of one old woman who was silly.&nbsp; She was a boy&rsquo;s
nurse, and she gave the boy a thing which she said was one of the snakes
which St. Hilda turned into stone; and told him that they found plenty
of them at Whitby, where she was born, all coiled up; but what was very
odd, their heads had always been broken of.&nbsp; And when he took it,
to his father, he told him it was only a fossil shell&mdash;an Ammonite.&nbsp;
And he went back and laughed at his nurse, and teased her till she was
quite angry.</p>
<p>Then he was very lucky that she did not box his ears, for that was
what he deserved.&nbsp; I dare say that, though his nurse had never
heard of Ammonites, she was a wise old dame enough, and knew a hundred
things which he did not know, and which were far more important than
Ammonites, even to him.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Because if she had not known how to nurse him well, he would perhaps
have never grown up alive and strong.&nbsp; And if she had not known
how to make him obey and speak the truth, he might have grown up a naughty
boy.</p>
<p>But was she not silly?</p>
<p>No.&nbsp; She only believed what the Whitby folk, I understand, have
some of them believed for many hundred years.&nbsp; And no one can be
blamed for thinking as his forefathers did, unless he has cause to know
better.</p>
<p>Surely she might have known better?</p>
<p>How?&nbsp; What reason could she have to believe the Ammonite was
a shell?&nbsp; It is not the least like cockles, or whelks, or any shell
she ever saw.</p>
<p>What reason either could she have to guess that Whitby cliff had
once been coral-mud, at the bottom of the sea?&nbsp; No more reason,
my dear child, than you would have to guess that this stone had been
coral-mud likewise, if I did not teach you so,&mdash;or rather, try
to make you teach yourself so.</p>
<p>No.&nbsp; I say it again.&nbsp; If you wish to learn, I will only
teach you on condition that you do not laugh at, or despise, those good
and honest and able people who do not know or care about these things,
because they have other things to think of: like old John out there
ploughing.&nbsp; He would not believe you&mdash;he would hardly believe
me&mdash;if we told him that this stone had been once a swarm of living
things, of exquisite shapes and glorious colours.&nbsp; And yet he can
plough and sow, and reap and mow, and fell and strip, and hedge and
ditch, and give his neighbours sound advice, and take the measure of
a man&rsquo;s worth from ten minutes&rsquo; talk, and say his prayers,
and keep his temper, and pay his debts,&mdash;which last three things
are more than a good many folks can do who fancy themselves a whole
world wiser than John in the smock-frock.</p>
<p>Oh, but I want to hear about the exquisite shapes and glorious colours.</p>
<p>Of course you do, little man.&nbsp; A few fine epithets take your
fancy far more than a little common sense and common humility; but in
that you are no worse than some of your elders.&nbsp; So now for the
exquisite shapes and glorious colours.&nbsp; I have never seen them;
though I trust to see them ere I die.&nbsp; So what they are like I
can only tell from what I have learnt from Mr. Darwin, and Mr. Wallace,
and Mr. Jukes, and Mr. Gosse, and last, but not least, from one whose
soul was as beautiful as his face, Lucas Barrett,&mdash;too soon lost
to science,&mdash;who was drowned in exploring such a coral-reef as
this stone was once.</p>
<p>Then there are such things alive now?</p>
<p>Yes, and no.&nbsp; The descendants of most of them live on, altered
by time, which alters all things; and from the beauty of the children
we can guess at the beauty of their ancestors; just as from the coral-reefs
which exist now we can guess how the coral-reefs of old were made.&nbsp;
And that this stone was once part of a coral-reef the corals in it prove
at first sight.</p>
<p>And what is a coral-reef like?</p>
<p>You have seen the room in the British Museum full of corals, madrepores,
brain-stones, corallines, and sea-ferns?</p>
<p>Oh yes.</p>
<p>Then fancy all those alive.&nbsp; Not as they are now, white stone:
but covered in jelly; and out of every pore a little polype, like a
flower, peeping out.&nbsp; Fancy them of every gaudy colour you choose.&nbsp;
No bed of flowers, they say, can be more brilliant than the corals,
as you look down on them through the clear sea.&nbsp; Fancy, again,
growing among them and crawling over them, strange sea-anemones, shells,
star-fish, sea-slugs, and sea-cucumbers with feathery gills, crabs,
and shrimps, and hundreds of other animals, all as strange in shape,
and as brilliant in colour.&nbsp; You may let your fancy run wild.&nbsp;
Nothing so odd, nothing so gay, even entered your dreams, or a poet&rsquo;s,
as you may find alive at the bottom of the sea, in the live flower-gardens
of the sea-fairies.</p>
<p>There will be shoals of fish, too, playing in and out, as strange
and gaudy as the rest,&mdash;parrot-fish who browse on the live coral
with their beak-like teeth, as cattle browse on grass; and at the bottom,
it may be, larger and uglier fish, who eat the crabs and shell-fish,
shells and all, grinding them up as a dog grinds a bone, and so turning
shells and corals into fine soft mud, such as this stone is partly made
of.</p>
<p>But what happens to all the delicate little corals if a storm comes
on?</p>
<p>What, indeed?&nbsp; Madam How has made them so well and wisely, that,
like brave and good men, the more trouble they suffer the stronger they
are.&nbsp; Day and night, week after week, the trade-wind blows upon
them, hurling the waves against them in furious surf, knocking off great
lumps of coral, grinding them to powder, throwing them over the reef
into the shallow water inside.&nbsp; But the heavier the surf beats
upon them, the stronger the polypes outside grow, repairing their broken
houses, and building up fresh coral on the dead coral below, because
it is in the fresh sea-water that beats upon the surf that they find
most lime with which to build.&nbsp; And as they build they form a barrier
against the surf, inside of which, in water still as glass, the weaker
and more delicate things can grow in safety, just as these very Encrinites
may have grown, rooted in the lime-mud, and waving their slender arms
at the bottom of the clear lagoon.&nbsp; Such mighty builders are these
little coral polypes, that all the works of men are small compared with
theirs.&nbsp; One single reef, for instance, which is entirely made
by them, stretches along the north-east coast of Australia for nearly
a thousand miles.&nbsp; Of this you must read some day in Mr. Jukes&rsquo;s
<i>Voyage of H.M.S. &ldquo;Fly</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Every island throughout
a great part of the Pacific is fringed round each with its coral-reef,
and there are hundreds of islands of strange shapes, and of Atolls,
as they are called, or ring-islands, which are composed entirely of
coral, and of nothing else.</p>
<p>A ring-island?&nbsp; How can an island be made in the shape of a
ring?</p>
<p>Ah! it was a long time before men found out that riddle.&nbsp; Mr.
Darwin was the first to guess the answer, as he has guessed many an
answer beside.&nbsp; These islands are each a ring, or nearly a ring
of coral, with smooth shallow water inside: but their outsides run down,
like a mountain wall, sheer into seas hundreds of fathoms deep.&nbsp;
People used to believe, and reasonably enough, that the coral polypes
began to build up the islands from the very bottom of the deep sea.</p>
<p>But that would not account for the top of them being of the shape
of a ring; and in time it was found out that the corals would not build
except in shallow water, twenty or thirty fathoms deep at most, and
men were at their wits&rsquo; ends to find out the riddle.&nbsp; Then
said Mr. Darwin, &ldquo;Suppose one of those beautiful South Sea Islands,
like Tahiti, the Queen of Isles, with its ring of coral-reef all round
its shore, began sinking slowly under the sea.&nbsp; The land, as it
sunk, would be gone for good and all: but the coral-reef round it would
not, because the coral polypes would build up and up continually upon
the skeletons of their dead parents, to get to the surface of the water,
and would keep close to the top outside, however much the land sunk
inside; and when the island had sunk completely beneath the sea, what
would be left?&nbsp; What must be left but a ring of coral reef, around
the spot where the last mountain peak of the island sank beneath the
sea?&rdquo;&nbsp; And so Mr. Darwin explained the shapes of hundreds
of coral islands in the Pacific; and proved, too, some strange things
besides (he proved, and other men, like Mr. Wallace, whose excellent
book on the East Indian islands you must read some day, have proved
in other ways) that there was once a great continent, joined perhaps
to Australia and to New Guinea, in the Pacific Ocean, where is now nothing
but deep sea, and coral-reefs which mark the mountain ranges of that
sunken world.</p>
<p>But how does the coral ever rise above the surface of the water and
turn into hard stone?</p>
<p>Of course the coral polypes cannot build above the high-tide mark;
but the surf which beats upon them piles up their broken fragments just
as a sea-beach is piled up, and hammers them together with that water
hammer which is heavier and stronger than any you have ever seen in
a smith&rsquo;s forge.&nbsp; And then, as is the fashion of lime, the
whole mass sets and becomes hard, as you may see mortar set; and so
you have a low island a few feet above the sea.&nbsp; Then sea-birds
come to it, and rest and build; and seeds are floated thither from far
lands; and among them almost always the cocoa-nut, which loves to grow
by the sea-shore, and groves of cocoa palms grow up upon the lonely
isle.&nbsp; Then, perhaps, trees and bushes are drifted thither before
the trade-wind; and entangled in their roots are seeds of other plants,
and eggs or cocoons of insects; and so a few flowers and a few butterflies
and beetles set up for themselves upon the new land.&nbsp; And then
a bird or two, caught in a storm and blown away to sea finds shelter
in the cocoa-grove; and so a little new world is set up, in which (you
must remember always) there are no four-footed beasts, nor snakes, nor
lizards, nor frogs, nor any animals that cannot cross the sea.&nbsp;
And on some of those islands they may live (indeed there is reason to
believe they have lived), so long, that some of them have changed their
forms, according to the laws of Madam How, who sooner or later fits
each thing exactly for the place in which it is meant to live, till
upon some of them you may find such strange and unique creatures as
the famous cocoa-nut crab, which learned men call <i>Birgus latro</i>.&nbsp;
A great crab he is, who walks upon the tips of his toes a foot high
above the ground.&nbsp; And because he has often nothing to eat but
cocoa-nuts, or at least they are the best things he can find, cocoa-nuts
he has learned to eat, and after a fashion which it would puzzle you
to imitate.&nbsp; Some say that he climbs up the stems of the cocoa-nut
trees, and pulls the fruit down for himself; but that, it seems, he
does not usually do.&nbsp; What he does is this: when he finds a fallen
cocoa-nut, he begins tearing away the thick husk and fibre with his
strong claws; and he knows perfectly well which end to tear it from,
namely, from the end where the three eye-holes are, which you call the
monkey&rsquo;s face, out of one of which you know, the young cocoa-nut
tree would burst forth.&nbsp; And when he has got to the eye-holes,
he hammers through one of them with the point of his heavy claw.&nbsp;
So far, so good: but how is he to get the meat out?&nbsp; He cannot
put his claw in.&nbsp; He has no proboscis like a butterfly to insert
and suck with.&nbsp; He is as far off from his dinner as the fox was
when the stork offered him a feast in a long-necked jar.&nbsp; What
then do you think he does?&nbsp; He turns himself round, puts in a pair
of his hind pincers, which are very slender, and with them scoops the
meat out of the cocoa-nut, and so puts his dinner into his mouth with
his hind feet.&nbsp; And even the cocoa-nut husk he does not waste;
for he lives in deep burrows which he makes like a rabbit; and being
a luxurious crab, and liking to sleep soft in spite of his hard shell,
he lines them with a quantity of cocoa-nut fibre, picked out clean and
fine, just as if he was going to make cocoa-nut matting of it.&nbsp;
And being also a clean crab, as I hope you are a clean little boy, he
goes down to the sea every night to have his bath and moisten his gills,
and so lives happy all his days, and gets so fat in his old age that
he carries about his body nearly a quart of pure oil.</p>
<p>That is the history of the cocoa-nut crab.&nbsp; And if any one tells
me that that crab acts only on what is called &ldquo;instinct&rdquo;;
and does not think and reason, just as you and I think and reason, though
of course not in words as you and I do: then I shall be inclined to
say that that person does not think nor reason either.</p>
<p>Then were there many coral-reefs in Britain in old times?</p>
<p>Yes, many and many, again and again; some whole ages older than this,
a bit of which you see, and some again whole ages newer.&nbsp; But look:
then judge for yourself.&nbsp; Look at this geological map.&nbsp; Wherever
you see a bit of blue, which is the mark for limestone, you may say,
&ldquo;There is a bit of old coral-reef rising up to the surface.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But because I will not puzzle your little head with too many things
at once, you shall look at one set of coral-reefs which are far newer
than this bit of Dudley limestone, and which are the largest, I suppose,
that ever were in this country; or, at least, there is more of them
left than of any others.</p>
<p>Look first at Ireland.&nbsp; You see that almost all the middle of
Ireland is coloured blue.&nbsp; It is one great sheet of old coral-reef
and coral-mud, which is now called the carboniferous limestone.&nbsp;
You see red and purple patches rising out of it, like islands&mdash;and
islands I suppose they were, of hard and ancient rock, standing up in
the middle of the coral sea.</p>
<p>But look again, and you will see that along the west coast of Ireland,
except in a very few places, like Galway Bay, the blue limestone does
not come down to the sea; the shore is coloured purple and brown, and
those colours mark the ancient rocks and high mountains of Mayo and
Galway and Kerry, which stand as barriers to keep the raging surf of
the Atlantic from bursting inland and beating away, as it surely would
in course of time, the low flat limestone plain of the middle of Ireland.&nbsp;
But the same coral-reefs once stretched out far to the westward into
the Atlantic Ocean; and you may see the proof upon that map.&nbsp; For
in the western bays, in Clew Bay with its hundred islands, and Galway
Bay with its Isles of Arran, and beautiful Kenmare, and beautiful Bantry,
you see little blue spots, which are low limestone islands, standing
in the sea, overhung by mountains far aloft.&nbsp; You have often heard
those islands in Kenmare Bay talked of, and how some whom you know go
to fish round them by night for turbot and conger; and when you hear
them spoken of again, you must recollect that they are the last fragments
of a great fringing coral-reef, which will in a few thousand years follow
the fate of the rest, and be eaten up by the waves, while the mountains
of hard rock stand round them still unchanged.</p>
<p>Now look at England, and there you will see patches at least of a
great coral-reef which was forming at the same time as that Irish one,
and on which perhaps some of your schoolfellows have often stood.&nbsp;
You have heard of St. Vincent&rsquo;s Rocks at Bristol, and the marble
cliffs, 250 feet in height, covered in part with rich wood and rare
flowers, and the Avon running through the narrow gorge, and the stately
ships sailing far below your feet from Bristol to the Severn sea.&nbsp;
And you may see, for here they are, corals from St. Vincent&rsquo;s
Rocks, cut and polished, showing too that they also, like the Dudley
limestone, are made up of corals and of coral-mud.&nbsp; Now, whenever
you see St. Vincent&rsquo;s Rocks, as I suspect you very soon will,
recollect where you are, and use your fancy, to paint for yourself a
picture as strange as it is true.&nbsp; Fancy that those rocks are what
they once were, a coral-reef close to the surface of a shallow sea.&nbsp;
Fancy that there is no gorge of the Avon, no wide Severn sea&mdash;for
those were eaten out by water ages and ages afterwards.&nbsp; But picture
to yourself the coral sea reaching away to the north, to the foot of
the Welsh mountains; and then fancy yourself, if you will, in a canoe,
paddling up through the coral-reefs, north and still north, up the valley
down which the Severn now flows, up through what is now Worcestershire,
then up through Staffordshire, then through Derbyshire, into Yorkshire,
and so on through Durham and Northumberland, till your find yourself
stopped by the Ettrick hills in Scotland; while all to the westward
of you, where is now the greater part of England, was open sea.&nbsp;
You may say, if you know anything of the geography of England, &ldquo;Impossible!&nbsp;
That would be to paddle over the tops of high mountains; over the top
of the Peak in Derbyshire, over the top of High Craven and Whernside
and Pen-y-gent and Cross Fell, and to paddle too over the Cheviot Hills,
which part England and Scotland.&rdquo;&nbsp; I know it, my child, I
know it.&nbsp; But so it was once on a time.&nbsp; The high limestone
mountains which part Lancashire and Yorkshire&mdash;the very chine and
backbone of England&mdash;were once coral-reefs at the bottom of the
sea.&nbsp; They are all made up of the carboniferous limestone, so called,
as your little knowledge of Latin ought to tell you, because it carries
the coal; because the coalfields usually lie upon it.&nbsp; It may be
impossible in your eyes: but remember always that nothing is impossible
with God.</p>
<p>But you said that the coal was made from plants and trees, and did
plants and trees grow on this coral-reef?</p>
<p>That I cannot say.&nbsp; Trees may have grown on the dry parts of
the reef, as cocoa-nuts grow now in the Pacific.&nbsp; But the coal
was not laid down upon it till long afterwards, when it had gone through
many and strange changes.&nbsp; For all through the chine of England,
and in a part of Ireland too, there lies upon the top of the limestone
a hard gritty rock, in some places three thousand feet thick, which
is commonly called &ldquo;the mill-stone grit.&rdquo;&nbsp; And above
that again the coal begins.&nbsp; Now to make that 3000 feet of hard
rock, what must have happened?&nbsp; The sea-bottom must have sunk,
slowly no doubt, carrying the coral-reefs down with it, 3000 feet at
least.&nbsp; And meanwhile sand and mud, made from the wearing away
of the old lands in the North must have settled down upon it.&nbsp;
I say from the North&mdash;for there are no fossils, as far as I know,
or sign of life, in these rocks of mill-stone grit; and therefore it
is reasonable to suppose that they were brought from a cold current
at the Pole, too cold to allow sea-beasts to live,&mdash;quite cold
enough, certainly, to kill coral insects, who could only thrive in warm
water coming from the South.</p>
<p>Then, to go on with my story, upon the top of these mill-stone grits
came sand and mud, and peat, and trees, and plants, washed out to sea,
as far as we can guess, from the mouths of vast rivers flowing from
the West, rivers as vast as the Amazon, the Mississippi, or the Orinoco
are now; and so in long ages, upon the top of the limestone and upon
the top of the mill-stone grit, were laid down those beds of coal which
you see burnt now in every fire.</p>
<p>But how did the coral-reefs rise till they became cliffs at Bristol
and mountains in Yorkshire?</p>
<p>The earthquake steam, I suppose, raised them.&nbsp; One earthquake
indeed, or series of earthquakes, there was, running along between Lancashire
and Yorkshire, which made that vast crack and upheaval in the rocks,
the Craven Fault, running, I believe, for more than a hundred miles,
and lifting the rocks in some places several hundred feet.&nbsp; That
earthquake helped to make the high hills which overhang Manchester and
Preston, and all the manufacturing county of Lancashire.&nbsp; That
earthquake helped to make the perpendicular cliff at Malham Cove, and
many another beautiful bit of scenery.&nbsp; And that and other earthquakes,
by heating the rocks from the fires below, may have helped to change
them from soft coral into hard crystalline marble as you see them now,
just as volcanic heat has hardened and purified the beautiful white
marbles of Pentelicus and Paros in Greece, and Carrara in Italy, from
which statues are carved unto this day.&nbsp; Or the same earthquake
may have heated and hardened the limestones simply by grinding and squeezing
them; or they may have been heated and hardened in the course of long
ages simply by the weight of the thousands of feet of other rock which
lay upon them.&nbsp; For pressure, you must remember, produces heat.&nbsp;
When you strike flint and steel together, the pressure of the blow not
only makes bits of steel fly off, but makes them fly off in red-hot
sparks.&nbsp; When you hammer a piece of iron with a hammer, you will
soon find it get quite warm.&nbsp; When you squeeze the air together
in your pop-gun, you actually make the air inside warmer, till the pellet
flies out, and the air expands and cools again.&nbsp; Nay, I believe
you cannot hold up a stone on the palm of your hand without that stone
after a while warming your hand, because it presses against you in trying
to fall, and you press against it in trying to hold it up.&nbsp; And
recollect above all the great and beautiful example of that law which
you were lucky enough to see on the night of the 14th of November 1867,
how those falling stars, as I told you then, were coming out of boundless
space, colder than any ice on earth, and yet, simply by pressing against
the air above our heads, they had their motion turned into heat, till
they burned themselves up into trains of fiery dust.&nbsp; So remember
that wherever you have pressure you have heat, and that the pressure
of the upper rocks upon the lower is quite enough, some think, to account
for the older and lower rocks being harder than the upper and newer
ones.</p>
<p>But why should the lower rocks be older and the upper rocks newer?&nbsp;
You told me just now that the high mountains in Wales were ages older
than Windsor Forest, upon which we stand: but yet how much lower we
are here than if we were on a Welsh mountain.</p>
<p>Ah, my dear child, of course that puzzles you, and I am afraid it
must puzzle you still till we have another talk; or rather it seems
to me that the best way to explain that puzzle to you would be for you
and me to go a journey into the far west, and look into the matter for
ourselves; and from here to the far west we will go, either in fancy
or on a real railroad and steamboat, before we have another talk about
these things.</p>
<p>Now it is time to stop.&nbsp; Is there anything more you want to
know? for you look as if something was puzzling you still.</p>
<p>Were there any men in the world while all this was going on?</p>
<p>I think not.&nbsp; We have no proof that there were not: but also
we have no proof that there were; the cave-men, of whom I told you,
lived many ages after the coal was covered up.&nbsp; You seem to be
sorry that there were no men in the world then.</p>
<p>Because it seems a pity that there was no one to see those beautiful
coral-reefs and coal-forests.</p>
<p>No one to see them, my child?&nbsp; Who told you that?&nbsp; Who
told you there are not, and never have been any rational beings in this
vast universe, save certain weak, ignorant, short-sighted creatures
shaped like you and me?&nbsp; But even if it were so, and no created
eye had ever beheld those ancient wonders, and no created heart ever
enjoyed them, is there not one Uncreated who has seen them and enjoyed
them from the beginning?&nbsp; Were not these creatures enjoying themselves
each after their kind?&nbsp; And was there not a Father in Heaven who
was enjoying their enjoyment, and enjoying too their beauty, which He
had formed according to the ideas of His Eternal Mind?&nbsp; Recollect
what you were told on Trinity Sunday&mdash;That this world was not made
for man alone: but that man, and this world, and the whole Universe
was made for God; for He created all things, and for His pleasure they
are, and were created.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X&mdash;FIELD AND WILD</h2>
<p>Where were we to go next?&nbsp; Into the far west, to see how all
the way along the railroads the new rocks and soils lie above the older,
and yet how, when we get westward, the oldest rocks rise highest into
the air.</p>
<p>Well, we will go: but not, I think, to-day.&nbsp; Indeed I hardly
know how we could get as far as Reading; for all the world is in the
hay-field, and even the old horse must go thither too, and take his
turn at the hay-cart.&nbsp; Well, the rocks have been where they are
for many a year, and they will wait our leisure patiently enough: but
Midsummer and the hay-field will not wait.&nbsp; Let us take what God
gives when He sends it, and learn the lesson that lies nearest to us.&nbsp;
After all, it is more to my old mind, and perhaps to your young mind
too, to look at things which are young and fresh and living, rather
than things which are old and worn and dead.&nbsp; Let us leave the
old stones, and the old bones, and the old shells, the wrecks of ancient
worlds which have gone down into the kingdom of death, to teach us their
grand lessons some other day; and let us look now at the world of light
and life and beauty, which begins here at the open door, and stretches
away over the hay-fields, over the woods, over the southern moors, over
sunny France, and sunnier Spain, and over the tropic seas, down to the
equator, and the palm-groves of the eternal summer.&nbsp; If we cannot
find something, even at starting from the open door, to teach us about
Why and How, we must be very short-sighted, or very shallow-hearted.</p>
<p>There is the old cock starling screeching in the eaves, because he
wants to frighten us away, and take a worm to his children, without
our finding out whereabouts his hole is.&nbsp; How does he know that
we might hurt him? and how again does he not know that we shall not
hurt him? we, who for five-and-twenty years have let him and his ancestors
build under those eaves in peace?&nbsp; How did he get that quantity
of half-wit, that sort of stupid cunning, into his little brain, and
yet get no more?&nbsp; And why (for this is a question of Why, and not
of How) does he labour all day long, hunting for worms and insects for
his children, while his wife nurses them in the nest?&nbsp; Why, too,
did he help her to build that nest with toil and care this spring, for
the sake of a set of nestlings who can be of no gain or use to him,
but only take the food out of his mouth?&nbsp; Simply out of&mdash;what
shall I call it, my child?&mdash;Love; that same sense of love and duty,
coming surely from that one Fountain of all duty and all love, which
makes your father work for you.&nbsp; That the mother should take care
of her young, is wonderful enough; but that (at least among many birds)
the father should help likewise, is (as you will find out as you grow
older) more wonderful far.&nbsp; So there already the old starling has
set us two fresh puzzles about How and Why, neither of which we shall
get answered, at least on this side of the grave.</p>
<p>Come on, up the field, under the great generous sun, who quarrels
with no one, grudges no one, but shines alike upon the evil and the
good.&nbsp; What a gay picture he is painting now, with his light-pencils;
for in them, remember, and not in the things themselves the colour lies.&nbsp;
See how, where the hay has been already carried, he floods all the slopes
with yellow light, making them stand out sharp against the black shadows
of the wood; while where the grass is standing still, he makes the sheets
of sorrel-flower blush rosy red, or dapples the field with white oxeyes.</p>
<p>But is not the sorrel itself red, and the oxeyes white?</p>
<p>What colour are they at night, when the sun is gone?</p>
<p>Dark.</p>
<p>That is, no colour.&nbsp; The very grass is not green at night.</p>
<p>Oh, but it is if you look at it with a lantern.</p>
<p>No, no.&nbsp; It is the light of the lantern, which happens to be
strong enough to make the leaves look green, though it is not strong
enough to make a geranium look red.</p>
<p>Not red?</p>
<p>No; the geranium flowers by a lantern look black, while the leaves
look green.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t believe me, we will try.</p>
<p>But why is that?</p>
<p>Why, I cannot tell: and how, you had best ask Professor Tyndall,
if you ever have the honour of meeting him.</p>
<p>But now&mdash;hark to the mowing-machine, humming like a giant night-jar.&nbsp;
Come up and look at it, and see how swift and smooth it shears the long
grass down, so that in the middle of the swathe it seems to have merely
fallen flat, and you must move it before you find that it has been cut
off.</p>
<p>Ah, there is a proof to us of what men may do if they will only learn
the lessons which Madam How can teach them.&nbsp; There is that boy,
fresh from the National School, cutting more grass in a day than six
strong mowers could have cut, and cutting it better, too; for the mowing-machine
goes so much nearer to the ground than the scythe, that we gain by it
two hundredweight of hay on every acre.&nbsp; And see, too, how persevering
old Madam How will not stop her work, though the machine has cut off
all the grass which she has been making for the last three months; for
as fast as we shear it off, she makes it grow again.&nbsp; There are
fresh blades, here at our feet, a full inch long, which have sprung
up in the last two days, for the cattle when they are turned in next
week.</p>
<p>But if the machine cuts all the grass, the poor mowers will have
nothing to do.</p>
<p>Not so.&nbsp; They are all busy enough elsewhere.&nbsp; There is
plenty of other work to be done, thank God; and wholesomer and easier
work than mowing with a burning sun on their backs, drinking gallons
of beer, and getting first hot and then cold across the loins, till
they lay in a store of lumbago and sciatica, to cripple them in their
old age.&nbsp; You delight in machinery because it is curious: you should
delight in it besides because it does good, and nothing but good, where
it is used, according to the laws of Lady Why, with care, moderation,
and mercy, and fair-play between man and man.&nbsp; For example: just
as the mowing-machine saves the mowers, the threshing-machine saves
the threshers from rheumatism and chest complaints,&mdash;which they
used to catch in the draught and dust of the unhealthiest place in the
whole parish, which is, the old-fashioned barn&rsquo;s floor.&nbsp;
And so, we may hope, in future years all heavy drudgery and dirty work
will be done more and more by machines, and people will have more and
more chance of keeping themselves clean and healthy, and more and more
time to read, and learn, and think, and be true civilised men and women,
instead of being mere live ploughs, or live manure-carts, such as I
have seen ere now.</p>
<p>A live manure-cart?</p>
<p>Yes, child.&nbsp; If you had seen, as I have seen, in foreign lands,
poor women, haggard, dirty, grown old before their youth was over, toiling
up hill with baskets of foul manure upon their backs, you would have
said, as I have said, &ldquo;Oh for Madam How to cure that ignorance!&nbsp;
Oh for Lady Why to cure that barbarism!&nbsp; Oh that Madam How would
teach them that machinery must always be cheaper in the long run than
human muscles and nerves!&nbsp; Oh that Lady Why would teach them that
a woman is the most precious thing on earth, and that if she be turned
into a beast of burden, Lady Why&mdash;and Madam How likewise&mdash;will
surely avenge the wrongs of their human sister!&rdquo;&nbsp; There,
you do not quite know what I mean, and I do not care that you should.&nbsp;
It is good for little folk that big folk should now and then &ldquo;talk
over their heads,&rdquo; as the saying is, and make them feel how ignorant
they are, and how many solemn and earnest questions there are in the
world on which they must make up their minds some day, though not yet.&nbsp;
But now we will talk about the hay: or rather do you and the rest go
and play in the hay and gather it up, build forts of it, storm them,
pull them down, build them up again, shout, laugh, and scream till you
are hot and tired.&nbsp; You will please Madam How thereby, and Lady
Why likewise.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Because Madam How naturally wants her work to succeed, and she is
at work now making you.</p>
<p>Making me?</p>
<p>Of course.&nbsp; Making a man of you, out of a boy.&nbsp; And that
can only be done by the life-blood which runs through and through you.&nbsp;
And the more you laugh and shout, the more pure air will pass into your
blood, and make it red and healthy; and the more you romp and play&mdash;unless
you overtire yourself&mdash;the quicker will that blood flow through
all your limbs, to make bone and muscle, and help you to grow into a
man.</p>
<p>But why does Lady Why like to see us play?</p>
<p>She likes to see you happy, as she likes to see the trees and birds
happy.&nbsp; For she knows well that there is no food, nor medicine
either, like happiness.&nbsp; If people are not happy enough, they are
often tempted to do many wrong deeds, and to think many wrong thoughts:
and if by God&rsquo;s grace they know the laws of Lady Why, and keep
from sin, still unhappiness, if it goes on too long, wears them out,
body and mind; and they grow ill and die, of broken hearts, and broken
brains, my child; and so at last, poor souls, find &ldquo;Rest beneath
the Cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Children, too, who are unhappy; children who are bullied, and frightened,
and kept dull and silent, never thrive.&nbsp; Their bodies do not thrive;
for they grow up weak.&nbsp; Their minds do not thrive; for they grow
up dull.&nbsp; Their souls do not thrive; for they learn mean, sly,
slavish ways, which God forbid you should ever learn.&nbsp; Well said
the wise man, &ldquo;The human plant, like the vegetables, can only
flower in sunshine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So do you go, and enjoy yourself in the sunshine; but remember this&mdash;You
know what happiness is.&nbsp; Then if you wish to please Lady Why, and
Lady Why&rsquo;s Lord and King likewise, you will never pass a little
child without trying to make it happier, even by a passing smile.&nbsp;
And now be off, and play in the hay, and come back to me when you are
tired.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Let us lie down at the foot of this old oak, and see what we can
see.</p>
<p>And hear what we can hear, too.&nbsp; What is that humming all round
us, now that the noisy mowing-machine has stopped?</p>
<p>And as much softer than the noise of mowing-machine hum, as the machines
which make it are more delicate and more curious.&nbsp; Madam How is
a very skilful workwoman, and has eyes which see deeper and clearer
than all microscopes; as you would find, if you tried to see what makes
that &ldquo;Midsummer hum&rdquo; of which the haymakers are so fond,
because it promises fair weather.</p>
<p>Why, it is only the gnats and flies.</p>
<p>Only the gnats and flies?&nbsp; You might study those gnats and flies
for your whole life without finding out all&mdash;or more than a very
little&mdash;about them.&nbsp; I wish I knew how they move those tiny
wings of theirs&mdash;a thousand times in a second, I dare say, some
of them.&nbsp; I wish I knew how far they know that they are happy&mdash;for
happy they must be, whether they know it or not.&nbsp; I wish I knew
how they live at all.&nbsp; I wish I even knew how many sorts there
are humming round us at this moment.</p>
<p>How many kinds?&nbsp; Three or four?</p>
<p>More probably thirty or forty round this single tree.</p>
<p>But why should there be so many kinds of living things?&nbsp; Would
not one or two have done just as well?</p>
<p>Why, indeed?&nbsp; Why should there not have been only one sort of
butterfly, and he only of one colour, a plain brown, or a plain white?</p>
<p>And why should there be so many sorts of birds, all robbing the garden
at once?&nbsp; Thrushes, and blackbirds, and sparrows, and chaffinches,
and greenfinches, and bullfinches, and tomtits.</p>
<p>And there are four kinds of tomtits round here, remember: but we
may go on with such talk for ever.&nbsp; Wiser men than we have asked
the same question: but Lady Why will not answer them yet.&nbsp; However,
there is another question, which Madam How seems inclined to answer
just now, which is almost as deep and mysterious.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p><i>How</i> all these different kinds of things became different.</p>
<p>Oh, do tell me!</p>
<p>Not I.&nbsp; You must begin at the beginning, before you can end
at the end, or even make one step towards the end.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>You must learn the differences between things, before you can find
out how those differences came about.&nbsp; You must learn Madam How&rsquo;s
alphabet before you can read her book.&nbsp; And Madam How&rsquo;s alphabet
of animals and plants is, Species, Kinds of things.&nbsp; You must see
which are like, and which unlike; what they are like in, and what they
are unlike in.&nbsp; You are beginning to do that with your collection
of butterflies.&nbsp; You like to arrange them, and those that are most
like nearest to each other, and to compare them.&nbsp; You must do that
with thousands of different kinds of things before you can read one
page of Madam How&rsquo;s Natural History Book rightly.</p>
<p>But it will take so much time and so much trouble.</p>
<p>God grant that you may not spend more time on worse matters, and
take more trouble over things which will profit you far less.&nbsp;
But so it must be, willy-nilly.&nbsp; You must learn the alphabet if
you mean to read.&nbsp; And you must learn the value of the figures
before you can do a sum.&nbsp; Why, what would you think of any one
who sat down to play at cards&mdash;for money too (which I hope and
trust you never will do)&mdash;before he knew the names of the cards,
and which counted highest, and took the other?</p>
<p>Of course he would be very foolish.</p>
<p>Just as foolish are those who make up &ldquo;theories&rdquo; (as
they call them) about this world, and how it was made, before they have
found out what the world is made of.&nbsp; You might as well try to
find out how this hay-field was made, without finding out first what
the hay is made of.</p>
<p>How the hay-field was made?&nbsp; Was it not always a hay-field?</p>
<p>Ah, yes; the old story, my child: Was not the earth always just what
it is now?&nbsp; Let us see for ourselves whether this was always a
hay-field.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Just pick out all the different kinds of plants and flowers you can
find round us here.&nbsp; How many do you think there are?</p>
<p>Oh&mdash;there seem to be four or five.</p>
<p>Just as there were three or four kinds of flies in the air.&nbsp;
Pick them, child, and count.&nbsp; Let us have facts.</p>
<p>How many?&nbsp; What! a dozen already?</p>
<p>Yes&mdash;and here is another, and another.&nbsp; Why, I have got
I don&rsquo;t know how many.</p>
<p>Why not?&nbsp; Bring them here, and let us see.&nbsp; Nine kinds
of grasses, and a rush.&nbsp; Six kinds of clovers and vetches; and
besides, dandelion, and rattle, and oxeye, and sorrel, and plantain,
and buttercup, and a little stitchwort, and pignut, and mouse-ear hawkweed,
too, which nobody wants.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because they are a sign that I am not a good farmer enough, and have
not quite turned my Wild into Field.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>Look outside the boundary fence, at the moors and woods; they are
forest, Wild&mdash;&ldquo;Wald,&rdquo; as the Germans would call it.&nbsp;
Inside the fence is Field&mdash;&ldquo;Feld,&rdquo; as the Germans would
call it.&nbsp; Guess why?</p>
<p>Is it because the trees inside have been felled?</p>
<p>Well, some say so, who know more than I.&nbsp; But now go over the
fence, and see how many of these plants you can find on the moor.</p>
<p>Oh, I think I know.&nbsp; I am so often on the moor.</p>
<p>I think you would find more kinds outside than you fancy.&nbsp; But
what do you know?</p>
<p>That beside some short fine grass about the cattle-paths, there are
hardly any grasses on the moor save deer&rsquo;s hair and glade-grass;
and all the rest is heath, and moss, and furze, and fern.</p>
<p>Softly&mdash;not all; you have forgotten the bog plants; and there
are (as I said) many more plants beside on the moor than you fancy.&nbsp;
But we will look into that another time.&nbsp; At all events, the plants
outside are on the whole quite different from the hay-field.</p>
<p>Of course: that is what makes the field look green and the moor brown.</p>
<p>Not a doubt.&nbsp; They are so different, that they look like bits
of two different continents.&nbsp; Scrambling over the fence is like
scrambling out of Europe into Australia.&nbsp; Now, how was that difference
made?&nbsp; Think.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t guess, but think.&nbsp; Why does
the rich grass come up to the bank, and yet not spread beyond it?</p>
<p>I suppose because it cannot get over.</p>
<p>Not get over?&nbsp; Would not the wind blow the seeds, and the birds
carry them?&nbsp; They do get over, in millions, I don&rsquo;t doubt,
every summer.</p>
<p>Then why do they not grow?</p>
<p>Think.</p>
<p>Is there any difference in the soil inside and out?</p>
<p>A very good guess.&nbsp; But guesses are no use without facts.&nbsp;
Look.</p>
<p>Oh, I remember now.&nbsp; I know now the soil of the field is brown,
like the garden; and the soil of the moor all black and peaty.</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; But if you dig down two or three feet, you will find the
soils of the moor and the field just the same.&nbsp; So perhaps the
top soils were once both alike.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Well, and what do you think about it now?&nbsp; I want you to look
and think.&nbsp; I want every one to look and think.&nbsp; Half the
misery in the world comes first from not looking, and then from not
thinking.&nbsp; And I do not want you to be miserable.</p>
<p>But shall I be miserable if I do not find out such little things
as this.</p>
<p>You will be miserable if you do not learn to understand little things:
because then you will not be able to understand great things when you
meet them.&nbsp; Children who are not trained to use their eyes and
their common sense grow up the more miserable the cleverer they are.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because they grow up what men call dreamers, and bigots, and fanatics,
causing misery to themselves and to all who deal with them.&nbsp; So
I say again, think.</p>
<p>Well, I suppose men must have altered the soil inside the bank.</p>
<p>Well done.&nbsp; But why do you think so?</p>
<p>Because, of course, some one made the bank; and the brown soil only
goes up to it.</p>
<p>Well, that is something like common sense.&nbsp; Now you will not
say any more, as the cows or the butterflies might, that the hay-field
was always there.</p>
<p>And how did men change the soil?</p>
<p>By tilling it with the plough, to sweeten it, and manuring it, to
make it rich.</p>
<p>And then did all these beautiful grasses grow up of themselves?</p>
<p>You ought to know that they most likely did not.&nbsp; You know the
new enclosures?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well then, do rich grasses come up on them, now that they are broken
up?</p>
<p>Oh no, nothing but groundsel, and a few weeds.</p>
<p>Just what, I dare say, came up here at first.&nbsp; But this land
was tilled for corn, for hundreds of years, I believe.&nbsp; And just
about one hundred years ago it was laid down in grass; that is, sown
with grass seeds.</p>
<p>And where did men get the grass seeds from?</p>
<p>Ah, that is a long story; and one that shows our forefathers (though
they knew nothing about railroads or electricity) were not such simpletons
as some folks think.&nbsp; The way it must have been done was this.&nbsp;
Men watched the natural pastures where cattle get fat on the wild grass,
as they do in the Fens, and many other parts of England.&nbsp; And then
they saved the seeds of those fattening wild grasses, and sowed them
in fresh spots.&nbsp; Often they made mistakes.&nbsp; They were careless,
and got weeds among the seed&mdash;like the buttercups, which do so
much harm to this pasture.&nbsp; Or they sowed on soil which would not
suit the seed, and it died.&nbsp; But at last, after many failures,
they have grown so careful and so clever, that you may send to certain
shops, saying what sort of soil yours is, and they will send you just
the seeds which will grow there, and no other; and then you have a good
pasture for as long as you choose to keep it good.</p>
<p>And how is it kept good?</p>
<p>Look at all those loads of hay, which are being carried off the field.&nbsp;
Do you think you can take all that away without putting anything in
its place?</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>If I took all the butter out of the churn, what must I do if I want
more butter still?</p>
<p>Put more cream in.</p>
<p>So, if I want more grass to grow, I must put on the soil more of
what grass is made of.</p>
<p>But the butter don&rsquo;t grow, and the grass does.</p>
<p>What does the grass grow in?</p>
<p>The soil.</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; Just as the butter grows in the churn.&nbsp; So you must
put fresh grass-stuff continually into the soil, as you put fresh cream
into the churn.&nbsp; You have heard the farm men say, &ldquo;That crop
has taken a good deal out of the land&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Then they spoke exact truth.&nbsp; What will that hay turn into by
Christmas?&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you tell?&nbsp; Into milk, of course, which
you will drink; and into horseflesh too, which you will use.</p>
<p>Use horseflesh?&nbsp; Not eat it?</p>
<p>No; we have not got as far as that.&nbsp; We did not even make up
our minds to taste the Cambridge donkey.&nbsp; But every time the horse
draws the carriage, he uses up so much muscle; and that muscle he must
get back again by eating hay and corn; and that hay and corn must be
put back again into the land by manure, or there will be all the less
for the horse next year.&nbsp; For one cannot eat one&rsquo;s cake and
keep it too; and no more can one eat one&rsquo;s grass.</p>
<p>So this field is a truly wonderful place.&nbsp; It is no ugly pile
of brick and mortar, with a tall chimney pouring out smoke and evil
smells, with unhealthy, haggard people toiling inside.&nbsp; Why do
you look surprised?</p>
<p>Because&mdash;because nobody ever said it was.&nbsp; You mean a manufactory.</p>
<p>Well, and this hay-field is a manufactory: only like most of Madam
How&rsquo;s workshops, infinitely more beautiful, as well as infinitely
more crafty, than any manufactory of man&rsquo;s building.&nbsp; It
is beautiful to behold, and healthy to work in; a joy and blessing alike
to the eye, and the mind, and the body: and yet it is a manufactory.</p>
<p>But a manufactory of what?</p>
<p>Of milk of course, and cows, and sheep, and horses; and of your body
and mine&mdash;for we shall drink the milk and eat the meat.&nbsp; And
therefore it is a flesh and milk manufactory.&nbsp; We must put into
it every year yard-stuff, tank-stuff, guano, bones, and anything and
everything of that kin, that Madam How may cook it for us into grass,
and cook the grass again into milk and meat.&nbsp; But if we don&rsquo;t
give Madam How material to work on, we cannot expect her to work for
us.&nbsp; And what do you think will happen then?&nbsp; She will set
to work for herself.&nbsp; The rich grasses will dwindle for want of
ammonia (that is smelling salts), and the rich clovers for want of phosphates
(that is bone-earth): and in their places will come over the bank the
old weeds and grass off the moor, which have not room to get in now,
because the ground is coveted already.&nbsp; They want no ammonia nor
phosphates&mdash;at all events they have none, and that is why the cattle
on the moor never get fat.&nbsp; So they can live where these rich grasses
cannot.&nbsp; And then they will conquer and thrive; and the Field will
turn into Wild once more.</p>
<p>Ah, my child, thank God for your forefathers, when you look over
that boundary mark.&nbsp; For the difference between the Field and the
Wild is the difference between the old England of Madam How&rsquo;s
making, and the new England which she has taught man to make, carrying
on what she had only begun and had not time to finish.</p>
<p>That moor is a pattern bit left to show what the greater part of
this land was like for long ages after it had risen out of the sea;
when there was little or nothing on the flat upper moors save heaths,
and ling, and club-mosses, and soft gorse, and needle-whin, and creeping
willows; and furze and fern upon the brows; and in the bottoms oak and
ash, beech and alder, hazel and mountain ash, holly and thorn, with
here and there an aspen or a buckthorn (berry-bearing alder as you call
it), and everywhere&mdash;where he could thrust down his long root,
and thrust up his long shoots&mdash;that intruding conqueror and insolent
tyrant, the bramble.&nbsp; There were sedges and rushes, too, in the
bogs, and coarse grass on the forest pastures&mdash;or &ldquo;leas&rdquo;
as we call them to this day round here&mdash;but no real green fields;
and, I suspect, very few gay flowers, save in spring the sheets of golden
gorse, and in summer the purple heather.&nbsp; Such was old England&mdash;or
rather, such was this land before it was England; a far sadder, damper,
poorer land than now.&nbsp; For one man or one cow or sheep which could
have lived on it then, a hundred can live now.&nbsp; And yet, what it
was once, that it might become again,&mdash;it surely would round here,
if this brave English people died out of it, and the land was left to
itself once more.</p>
<p>What would happen then, you may guess for yourself, from what you
see happen whenever the land is left to itself, as it is in the wood
above.&nbsp; In that wood you can still see the grass ridges and furrows
which show that it was once ploughed and sown by man; perhaps as late
as the time of Henry the Eighth, when a great deal of poor land, as
you will read some day, was thrown out of tillage, to become forest
and down once more.&nbsp; And what is the mount now?&nbsp; A jungle
of oak and beech, cherry and holly, young and old all growing up together,
with the mountain ash and bramble and furze coming up so fast beneath
them, that we have to cut the paths clear again year by year.&nbsp;
Why, even the little cow-wheat, a very old-world plant, which only grows
in ancient woods, has found its way back again, I know not whence, and
covers the open spaces with its pretty yellow and white flowers.&nbsp;
Man had conquered this mount, you see, from Madam How, hundreds of years
ago.&nbsp; And she always lets man conquer her, because Lady Why wishes
man to conquer: only he must have a fair fight with Madam How first,
and try his strength against hers to the utmost.&nbsp; So man conquered
the wood for a while; and it became cornfield instead of forest: but
he was not strong and wise enough three hundred years ago to keep what
he had conquered; and back came Madam How, and took the place into her
own hands, and bade the old forest trees and plants come back again&mdash;as
they would come if they were not stopped year by year, down from the
wood, over the pastures&mdash;killing the rich grasses as they went,
till they met another forest coming up from below, and fought it for
many a year, till both made peace, and lived quietly side by side for
ages.</p>
<p>Another forest coming up from below?&nbsp; Where would it come from?</p>
<p>From where it is now.&nbsp; Come down and look along the brook, and
every drain and grip which runs into the brook.&nbsp; What is here?</p>
<p>Seedling alders, and some withies among them.</p>
<p>Very well.&nbsp; You know how we pull these alders up, and cut them
down, and yet they continually come again.&nbsp; Now, if we and all
human beings were to leave this pasture for a few hundred years, would
not those alders increase into a wood?&nbsp; Would they not kill the
grass, and spread right and left, seeding themselves more and more as
the grass died, and left the ground bare, till they met the oaks and
beeches coming down the hill?&nbsp; And then would begin a great fight,
for years and years, between oak and beech against alder and willow.</p>
<p>But how can trees fight?&nbsp; Could they move or beat each other
with their boughs?</p>
<p>Not quite that; though they do beat each other with their boughs,
fiercely enough, in a gale of wind; and then the trees who have strong
and stiff boughs wound those who have brittle and limp boughs, and so
hurt them, and if the storms come often enough, kill them.&nbsp; But
among these trees in a sheltered valley the larger and stronger would
kill the weaker and smaller by simply overshadowing their tops, and
starving their roots; starving them, indeed, so much when they grow
very thick, that the poor little acorns, and beech mast, and alder seeds
would not be able to sprout at all.&nbsp; So they would fight, killing
each other&rsquo;s children, till the war ended&mdash;I think I can
guess how.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>The beeches are as dainty as they are beautiful; and they do not
like to get their feet wet.&nbsp; So they would venture down the hill
only as far as the dry ground lasts, and those who tried to grow any
lower would die.&nbsp; But the oaks are hardy, and do not care much
where they grow.&nbsp; So they would fight their way down into the wet
ground among the alders and willows, till they came to where their enemies
were so thick and tall, that the acorns as they fell could not sprout
in the darkness.&nbsp; And so you would have at last, along the hill-side,
a forest of beech and oak, lower down a forest of oak and alder, and
along the stream-side alders and willows only.&nbsp; And that would
be a very fair example of the great law of the struggle for existence,
which causes the competition of species.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Madam How is very stern, though she is always perfectly just; and
therefore she makes every living thing fight for its life, and earn
its bread, from its birth till its death; and rewards it exactly according
to its deserts, and neither more nor less.</p>
<p>And the competition of species means, that each thing, and kind of
things, has to compete against the things round it; and to see which
is the stronger; and the stronger live, and breed, and spread, and the
weaker die out.</p>
<p>But that is very hard.</p>
<p>I know it, my child, I know it.&nbsp; But so it is.&nbsp; And Madam
How, no doubt, would be often very clumsy and very cruel, without meaning
it, because she never sees beyond her own nose, or thinks at all about
the consequences of what she is doing.&nbsp; But Lady Why, who does
think about consequences, is her mistress, and orders her about for
ever.&nbsp; And Lady Why is, I believe, as loving as she is wise; and
therefore we must trust that she guides this great war between living
things, and takes care that Madam How kills nothing which ought not
to die, and takes nothing away without putting something more beautiful
and something more useful in its place; and that even if England were,
which God forbid, overrun once more with forests and bramble-brakes,
that too would be of use somehow, somewhere, somewhen, in the long ages
which are to come hereafter.</p>
<p>And you must remember, too, that since men came into the world with
rational heads on their shoulders, Lady Why has been handing over more
and more of Madam How&rsquo;s work to them, and some of her own work
too: and bids them to put beautiful and useful things in the place of
ugly and useless ones; so that now it is men&rsquo;s own fault if they
do not use their wits, and do by all the world what they have done by
these pastures&mdash;change it from a barren moor into a rich hay-field,
by copying the laws of Madam How, and making grass compete against heath.&nbsp;
But you look thoughtful: what is it you want to know?</p>
<p>Why, you say all living things must fight and scramble for what they
can get from each other: and must not I too?&nbsp; For I am a living
thing.</p>
<p>Ah, that is the old question, which our Lord answered long ago, and
said, &ldquo;Be not anxious what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink,
or wherewithal you shall be clothed.&nbsp; For after all these things
do the heathen seek, and your Heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need
of these things.&nbsp; But seek ye first the kingdom of God and His
righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
A few, very few, people have taken that advice.&nbsp; But they have
been just the salt of the earth, which has kept mankind from decaying.</p>
<p>But what has that to do with it?</p>
<p>See.&nbsp; You are a living thing, you say.&nbsp; Are you a plant?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Are you an animal?</p>
<p>I do not know.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I suppose I am.&nbsp; I eat, and
drink, and sleep, just as dogs and cats do.</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; There is no denying that.&nbsp; No one knew that better
than St. Paul when he told men that they had a flesh; that is, a body,
and an animal&rsquo;s nature in them.&nbsp; But St. Paul told them&mdash;of
course he was not the first to say so, for all the wise heathens have
known that&mdash;that there was something more in us, which he called
a spirit.&nbsp; Some call it now the moral sentiment, some one thing,
some another, but we will keep to the old word: we shall not find a
better.</p>
<p>Yes, I know that I have a spirit, a soul.</p>
<p>Better to say that you are a spirit.&nbsp; But what does St. Paul
say?&nbsp; That our spirit is to conquer our flesh, and keep it down.&nbsp;
That the man in us, in short, which is made in the likeness of God,
is to conquer the animal in us, which is made in the likeness of the
dog and the cat, and sometimes (I fear) in the likeness of the ape or
the pig.&nbsp; You would not wish to be like a cat, much less like an
ape or a pig?</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p>Then do not copy them, by competing and struggling for existence
against other people.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>Did you never watch the pigs feeding?</p>
<p>Yes, and how they grudge and quarrel, and shove each other&rsquo;s
noses out of the trough, and even bite each other because they are so
jealous which shall get most.</p>
<p>That is it.&nbsp; And how the biggest pig drives the others away,
and would starve them while he got fat, if the man did not drive him
off in his turn.</p>
<p>Oh, yes; I know.</p>
<p>Then no wiser than those pigs are worldly men who compete, and grudge,
and struggle with each other, which shall get most money, most fame,
most power over their fellow-men.&nbsp; They will tell you, my child,
that that is the true philosophy, and the true wisdom; that competition
is the natural law of society, and the source of wealth and prosperity.&nbsp;
Do not you listen to them.&nbsp; That is the wisdom of this world, which
the flesh teaches the animals; and those who follow it, like the animals,
will perish.&nbsp; Such men are not even as wise as Sweep the retriever.</p>
<p>Not as wise as Sweep?</p>
<p>Not they.&nbsp; Sweep will not take away Victor&rsquo;s bone, though
he is ten times as big as Victor, and could kill him in a moment; and
when he catches a rabbit, does he eat it himself?</p>
<p>Of course not; he brings it and lays it down at our feet.</p>
<p>Because he likes better to do his duty, and be praised for it, than
to eat the rabbit, dearly as he longs to eat it.</p>
<p>But he is only an animal.&nbsp; Who taught him to be generous, and
dutiful, and faithful?</p>
<p>Who, indeed!&nbsp; Not we, you know that, for he has grown up with
us since a puppy.&nbsp; How he learnt it, and his parents before him,
is a mystery, of which we can only say, God has taught them, we know
not how.&nbsp; But see what has happened&mdash;that just because dogs
have learnt not to be selfish and to compete&mdash;that is, have become
civilised and tame&mdash;therefore we let them live with us, and love
them.&nbsp; Because they try to be good in their simple way, therefore
they too have all things added to them, and live far happier, and more
comfortable lives than the selfish wolf and fox.</p>
<p>But why have not all animals found out that?</p>
<p>I cannot tell: there may be wise animals and foolish animals, as
there are wise and foolish men.&nbsp; Indeed there are.&nbsp; I see
a very wise animal there, who never competes; for she has learned something
of the golden lesson&mdash;that it is more blessed to give than to receive;
and she acts on what she has learnt, all day long.</p>
<p>Which do you mean?&nbsp; Why, that is a bee.</p>
<p>Yes, it is a bee: and I wish I were as worthy in my place as that
bee is in hers.&nbsp; I wish I could act up as well as she does to the
true wisdom, which is self-sacrifice.&nbsp; For whom is that bee working?&nbsp;
For herself?&nbsp; If that was all, she only needs to suck the honey
as she goes.&nbsp; But she is storing up the wax under her stomach,
and bee-bread in her thighs&mdash;for whom?&nbsp; Not for herself only,
or even for her own children: but for the children of another bee, her
queen.&nbsp; For them she labours all day long, builds for them, feeds
them, nurses them, spends her love and cunning on them.&nbsp; So does
that ant on the path.&nbsp; She is carrying home that stick to build
for other ants&rsquo; children.&nbsp; So do the white ants in the tropics.&nbsp;
They have learnt not to compete, but to help each other; not to be selfish,
but to sacrifice themselves; and therefore they are strong.</p>
<p>But you told me once that ants would fight and plunder each other&rsquo;s
nests.&nbsp; And once we saw two hives of bees fighting in the air,
and falling dead by dozens.</p>
<p>My child, do not men fight, and kill each other by thousands with
sharp shot and cold steel, because, though they have learnt the virtue
of patriotism, they have not yet learnt that of humanity?&nbsp; We must
not blame the bees and ants if they are no wiser than men.&nbsp; At
least they are wise enough to stand up for their country, that is, their
hive, and work for it, and die for it, if need be; and that makes them
strong.</p>
<p>But how does that make them strong?</p>
<p>How, is a deep question, and one I can hardly answer yet.&nbsp; But
that it has made them so there is no doubt.&nbsp; Look at the solitary
bees&mdash;the governors as we call them, who live in pairs, in little
holes in the banks.&nbsp; How few of them there are; and they never
seem to increase in numbers.&nbsp; Then look at the hive bees, how,
just because they are civilised,&mdash;that is, because they help each
other, and feed each other, instead of being solitary and selfish,&mdash;they
breed so fast, and get so much food, that if they were not killed for
their honey, they would soon become a nuisance, and drive us out of
the parish.</p>
<p>But then we give them their hives ready made.</p>
<p>True.&nbsp; But in old forest countries, where trees decay and grow
hollow, the bees breed in them.</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; I remember the bee tree in the fir avenue.</p>
<p>Well then, in many forests in hot countries the bees swarm in hollow
trees; and they, and the ants, and the white ants, have it all their
own way, and are lords and masters, driving the very wild beasts before
them, while the ants and white ants eat up all gardens, and plantations,
and clothes, and furniture; till it is a serious question whether in
some hot countries man will ever be able to settle, so strong have the
ants grown, by ages of civilisation, and not competing against their
brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>But may I not compete for prizes against the other boys?</p>
<p>Well, there is no harm in that; for you do not harm the others, even
if you win.&nbsp; They will have learnt all the more, while trying for
the prize; and so will you, even if you don&rsquo;t get it.&nbsp; But
I tell you fairly, trying for prizes is only fit for a child; and when
you become a man, you must put away childish things&mdash;competition
among the rest.</p>
<p>But surely I may try to be better and wiser and more learned than
everybody else?</p>
<p>My dearest child, why try for that?&nbsp; Try to be as good, and
wise, and learned as you can, and if you find any man, or ten thousand
men, superior to you, thank God for it.&nbsp; Do you think that there
can be too much wisdom in the world?</p>
<p>Of course not: but I should like to be the wisest man in it.</p>
<p>Then you would only have the heaviest burden of all men on your shoulders.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because you would be responsible for more foolish people than any
one else.&nbsp; Remember what wise old Moses said, when some one came
and told him that certain men in the camp were prophesying&mdash;&ldquo;Would
God all the Lord&rsquo;s people did prophesy!&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes; it would
have saved Moses many a heartache, and many a sleepless night, if all
the Jews had been wise as he was, and wiser still.&nbsp; So do not you
compete with good and wise men, but simply copy them: and whatever you
do, do not compete with the wolves, and the apes, and the swine of this
world; for that is a game at which you are sure to be beaten.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because Lady Why, if she loves you (as I trust she does), will take
care that you are beaten, lest you should fancy it was really profitable
to live like a cunning sort of animal, and not like a true man.&nbsp;
And how she will do that I can tell you.&nbsp; She will take care that
you always come across a worse man than you are trying to be,&mdash;a
more apish man, who can tumble and play monkey-tricks for people&rsquo;s
amusement better than you can; or a more swinish man, who can get at
more of the pig&rsquo;s-wash than you can; or a more wolfish man, who
will eat you up if you do not get out of his way; and so she will disappoint
and disgust you, my child, with that greedy, selfish, vain animal life,
till you turn round and see your mistake, and try to live the true human
life, which also is divine;&mdash;to be just and honourable, gentle
and forgiving, generous and useful&mdash;in one word, to fear God, and
keep His commandments: and as you live that life, you will find that,
by the eternal laws of Lady Why, all other things will be added to you;
that people will be glad to know you, glad to help you, glad to employ
you, because they see that you will be of use to them, and will do them
no harm.&nbsp; And if you meet (as you will meet) with people better
and wiser than yourself, then so much the better for you; for they will
love you, and be glad to teach you when they see that you are living
the unselfish and harmless life; and that you come to them, not as foolish
Critias came to Socrates, to learn political cunning, and become a selfish
and ambitious tyrant, but as wise Plato came, that he might learn the
laws of Lady Why, and love them for her sake, and teach them to all
mankind.&nbsp; And so you, like the plants and animals, will get your
deserts exactly, without competing and struggling for existence as they
do.</p>
<p>And all this has come out of looking at the hay-field and the wild
moor.</p>
<p>Why not?&nbsp; There is an animal in you, and there is a man in you.&nbsp;
If the animal gets the upper hand, all your character will fall back
into wild useless moor; if the man gets the upper hand, all your character
will be cultivated into rich and fertile field.&nbsp; Choose.</p>
<p>Now come down home.&nbsp; The haymakers are resting under the hedge.&nbsp;
The horses are dawdling home to the farm.&nbsp; The sun is getting low,
and the shadows long.&nbsp; Come home, and go to bed while the house
is fragrant with the smell of hay, and dream that you are still playing
among the haycocks.&nbsp; When you grow old, you will have other and
sadder dreams.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI&mdash;THE WORLD&rsquo;S END</h2>
<p>Hullo! hi! wake up.&nbsp; Jump out of bed, and come to the window,
and see where you are.</p>
<p>What a wonderful place!</p>
<p>So it is: though it is only poor old Ireland.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
recollect that when we started I told you we were going to Ireland,
and through it to the World&rsquo;s End; and here we are now safe at
the end of the old world, and beyond us the great Atlantic, and beyond
that again, thousands of miles away, the new world, which will be rich
and prosperous, civilised and noble, thousands of years hence, when
this old world, it may be, will be dead, and little children there will
be reading in their history books of Ancient England and of Ancient
France, as you now read of Greece and Rome.</p>
<p>But what a wonderful place it is!&nbsp; What are those great green
things standing up in the sky, all over purple ribs and bars, with their
tops hid in the clouds?</p>
<p>Those are mountains; the bones of some old world, whose poor bare
sides Madam How is trying to cover with rich green grass.</p>
<p>And how far off are they?</p>
<p>How I should like to walk up to the top of that one which looks quite
close.</p>
<p>You will find it a long walk up there; three miles, I dare say, over
black bogs and banks of rock, and up corries and cliffs which you could
not climb.&nbsp; There are plenty of cows on that mountain: and yet
they look so small, you could not see them, nor I either, without a
glass.&nbsp; That long white streak, zigzagging down the mountain side,
is a roaring cataract of foam five hundred feet high, full now with
last night&rsquo;s rain; but by this afternoon it will have dwindled
to a little thread; and to-morrow, when you get up, if no more rain
has come down, it will be gone.&nbsp; Madam How works here among the
mountains swiftly and hugely, and sometimes terribly enough; as you
shall see when you have had your breakfast, and come down to the bridge
with me.</p>
<p>But what a beautiful place it is!&nbsp; Flowers and woods and a lawn;
and what is that great smooth patch in the lawn just under the window?</p>
<p>Is it an empty flower-bed?</p>
<p>Ah, thereby hangs a strange tale.&nbsp; We will go and look at it
after breakfast, and then you shall see with your own eyes one of the
wonders which I have been telling you of.</p>
<p>And what is that shining between the trees?</p>
<p>Water.</p>
<p>Is it a lake?</p>
<p>Not a lake, though there are plenty round here; that is salt water,
not fresh.&nbsp; Look away to the right, and you see it through the
opening of the woods again and again: and now look above the woods.&nbsp;
You see a faint blue line, and gray and purple lumps like clouds, which
rest upon it far away.&nbsp; That, child, is the great Atlantic Ocean,
and those are islands in the far west.&nbsp; The water which washes
the bottom of the lawn was but a few months ago pouring out of the Gulf
of Mexico, between the Bahamas and Florida, and swept away here as the
great ocean river of warm water which we call the Gulf Stream, bringing
with it out of the open ocean the shoals of mackerel, and the porpoises
and whales which feed upon them.&nbsp; Some fine afternoon we will run
down the bay and catch strange fishes, such as you never saw before,
and very likely see a living whale.</p>
<p>What? such a whale as they get whalebone from, and which eats sea-moths?</p>
<p>No, they live far north, in the Arctic circle; these are grampuses,
and bottle-noses, which feed on fish; not so big as the right whales,
but quite big enough to astonish you, if one comes up and blows close
to the boat.&nbsp; Get yourself dressed and come down, and then we will
go out; we shall have plenty to see and talk of at every step.</p>
<p>Now, you have finished your breakfast at last, so come along, and
we shall see what we shall see.&nbsp; First run out across the gravel,
and scramble up that bank of lawn, and you will see what you fancied
was an empty flower-bed.</p>
<p>Why, it is all hard rock.</p>
<p>Ah, you are come into the land of rocks now: out of the land of sand
and gravel; out of a soft young corner of the world into a very hard,
old, weather-beaten corner; and you will see rocks enough, and too many
for the poor farmers, before you go home again.</p>
<p>But how beautifully smooth and flat the rock is: and yet it is all
rounded.</p>
<p>What is it like?</p>
<p>Like&mdash;like the half of a shell.</p>
<p>Not badly said, but think again.</p>
<p>Like&mdash;like&mdash;I know what it is like.&nbsp; Like the back
of some great monster peeping up through the turf.</p>
<p>You have got it.&nbsp; Such rocks as these are called in Switzerland
&ldquo;roches moutonn&eacute;es,&rdquo; because they are, people fancy,
like sheep&rsquo;s backs.&nbsp; Now look at the cracks and layers in
it.&nbsp; They run across the stone; they have nothing to do with the
shape of it.&nbsp; You see that?</p>
<p>Yes: but here are cracks running across them, all along the stone,
till the turf hides them.</p>
<p>Look at them again; they are no cracks; they do not go into the stone.</p>
<p>I see.&nbsp; They are scratched; something like those on the elder-stem
at home, where the cats sharpen their claws.&nbsp; But it would take
a big cat to make them.</p>
<p>Do you recollect what I told you of Madam How&rsquo;s hand, more
flexible than any hand of man, and yet strong enough to grind the mountains
into paste?</p>
<p>I know.&nbsp; Ice! ice! ice!&nbsp; But are these really ice-marks?</p>
<p>Child, on the place where we now stand, over rich lawns, and warm
woods, and shining lochs, lay once on a time hundreds, it may be thousands,
of feet of solid ice, crawling off yonder mountain-tops into the ocean
there outside; and this is one of its tracks.&nbsp; See how the scratches
all point straight down the valley, and straight out to sea.&nbsp; Those
mountains are 2000 feet high: but they were much higher once; for the
ice has planed the tops off them.&nbsp; Then, it seems to me, the ice
sank, and left the mountains standing out of it about half their height,
and at that level it stayed, till it had planed down all those lower
moors of smooth bare rock between us and the Western ocean; and then
it sank again, and dwindled back, leaving moraines (that is, heaps of
dirt and stones) all up these valleys here and there, till at the last
it melted all away, and poor old Ireland became fit to live in again.&nbsp;
We will go down the bay some day and look at those moraines, some of
them quite hills of earth, and then you will see for yourself how mighty
a chisel the ice-chisel was, and what vast heaps of chips it has left
behind.&nbsp; Now then, down over the lawn towards the bridge.&nbsp;
Listen to the river, louder and louder every step we take.</p>
<p>What a roar!&nbsp; Is there a waterfall there?</p>
<p>No.&nbsp; It is only the flood.&nbsp; And underneath the roar of
that flood, do you not hear a deeper note&mdash;a dull rumbling, as
if from underground?</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; What is it?</p>
<p>The rolling of great stones under water, which are being polished
against each other, as they hurry toward the sea.&nbsp; Now, up on the
parapet of the bridge.&nbsp; I will hold you tight.&nbsp; Look and see
Madam How&rsquo;s rain-spade at work.&nbsp; Look at the terrible yellow
torrent below us, almost filling up the arches of the bridge, and leaping
high in waves and crests of foam.</p>
<p>Oh, the bridge is falling into the water!</p>
<p>Not a bit.&nbsp; You are not accustomed to see water running below
you at ten miles an hour.&nbsp; Never mind that feeling.&nbsp; It will
go off in a few seconds.&nbsp; Look; the water is full six feet up the
trunks of the trees; over the grass and the king fern, and the tall
purple loose-strife&mdash;</p>
<p>Oh!&nbsp; Here comes a tree dancing down!</p>
<p>And there are some turfs which have been cut on the mountain.&nbsp;
And there is a really sad sight.&nbsp; Look what comes now.</p>
<p>One&mdash;two&mdash;three.</p>
<p>Why, they are sheep.</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; And a sad loss they will be to some poor fellow in the
glen above.</p>
<p>And oh!&nbsp; Look at the pig turning round and round solemnly in
the corner under the rock.&nbsp; Poor piggy!&nbsp; He ought to have
been at home safe in his stye, and not wandering about the hills.&nbsp;
And what are these coming now?</p>
<p>Butter firkins, I think.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; This is a great flood.&nbsp;
It is well if there are no lives lost.</p>
<p>But is it not cruel of Madam How to make such floods?</p>
<p>Well&mdash;let us ask one of these men who are looking over the bridge.</p>
<p>Why, what does he say?&nbsp; I cannot understand one word.&nbsp;
Is he talking Irish?</p>
<p>Irish-English at least: but what he said was, that it was a mighty
fine flood entirely, praised be God; and would help on the potatoes
and oats after the drought, and set the grass growing again on the mountains.</p>
<p>And what is he saying now?</p>
<p>That the river will be full of salmon and white trout after this.</p>
<p>What does he mean?</p>
<p>That under our feet now, if we could see through the muddy water,
dozens of salmon and sea-trout are running up from the sea.</p>
<p>What! up this furious stream?</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; What would be death to you is pleasure and play to them.&nbsp;
Up they are going, to spawn in the little brooks among the mountains;
and all of them are the best of food, fattened on the herrings and sprats
in the sea outside, Madam How&rsquo;s free gift, which does not cost
man a farthing, save the expense of nets and rods to catch them.</p>
<p>How can that be?</p>
<p>I will give you a bit of political economy.&nbsp; Suppose a pound
of salmon is worth a shilling; and a pound of beef is worth a shilling
likewise.&nbsp; Before we can eat the beef, it has cost perhaps tenpence
to make that pound of beef out of turnips and grass and oil-cake; and
so the country is only twopence a pound richer for it.&nbsp; But Mr.
Salmon has made himself out of what he eats in the sea, and so has cost
nothing; and the shilling a pound is all clear gain.&nbsp; There&mdash;you
don&rsquo;t quite understand that piece of political economy.&nbsp;
Indeed, it is only in the last two or three years that older heads than
yours have got to understand it, and have passed the wise new salmon
laws, by which the rivers will be once more as rich with food as the
land is, just as they were hundreds of years ago.&nbsp; But now, look
again at the river.&nbsp; What do you think makes it so yellow and muddy?</p>
<p>Dirt, of course.</p>
<p>And where does that come from?</p>
<p>Off the mountains?</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; Tons on tons of white mud are being carried down past
us now; and where will they go?</p>
<p>Into the sea?</p>
<p>Yes, and sink there in the still water, to make new strata at the
bottom; and perhaps in them, ages hence, some one will find the bones
of those sheep, and of poor Mr. Pig too, fossil&mdash;</p>
<p>And the butter firkins too.&nbsp; What fun to find a fossil butter
firkin!</p>
<p>But now lift up your eyes to the jagged mountain crests, and their
dark sides all laced with silver streams.&nbsp; Out of every crack and
cranny there aloft, the rain is bringing down dirt, and stones too,
which have been split off by the winter&rsquo;s frosts, deepening every
little hollow, and sharpening every peak, and making the hills more
jagged and steep year by year.</p>
<p>When the ice went away, the hills were all scraped smooth and round
by the glaciers, like the flat rock upon the lawn; and ugly enough they
must have looked, most like great brown buns.&nbsp; But ever since then,
Madam How has been scooping them out again by her water-chisel into
deep glens, mighty cliffs, sharp peaks, such as you see aloft, and making
the old hills beautiful once more.&nbsp; Why, even the Alps in Switzerland
have been carved out by frost and rain, out of some great flat.&nbsp;
The very peak of the Matterhorn, of which you have so often seen a picture,
is but one single point left of some enormous bun of rock.&nbsp; All
the rest has been carved away by rain and frost; and some day the Matterhorn
itself will be carved away, and its last stone topple into the glacier
at its foot.&nbsp; See, as we have been talking, we have got into the
woods.</p>
<p>Oh, what beautiful woods, just like our own.</p>
<p>Not quite.&nbsp; There are some things growing here which do not
grow at home, as you will soon see.&nbsp; And there are no rocks at
home, either, as there are here.</p>
<p>How strange, to see trees growing out of rocks!&nbsp; How do their
roots get into the stone?</p>
<p>There is plenty of rich mould in the cracks for them to feed on&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Health to the oak of the mountains; he trusts
to the might of the rock-clefts.<br />
Deeply he mines, and in peace feeds on the wealth of the stone.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How many sorts of trees there are&mdash;oak, and birch and nuts,
and mountain-ash, and holly and furze, and heather.</p>
<p>And if you went to some of the islands in the lake up in the glen,
you would find wild arbutus&mdash;strawberry-tree, as you call it.&nbsp;
We will go and get some one day or other.</p>
<p>How long and green the grass is, even on the rocks, and the ferns,
and the moss, too.&nbsp; Everything seems richer here than at home.</p>
<p>Of course it is.&nbsp; You are here in the land of perpetual spring,
where frost and snow seldom, or never comes.</p>
<p>Oh, look at the ferns under this rock!&nbsp; I must pick some.</p>
<p>Pick away.&nbsp; I will warrant you do not pick all the sorts.</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; I have got them all now.</p>
<p>Not so hasty, child; there is plenty of a beautiful fern growing
among that moss, which you have passed over.&nbsp; Look here.</p>
<p>What! that little thing a fern!</p>
<p>Hold it up to the light, and see.</p>
<p>What a lovely little thing, like a transparent sea-weed, hung on
black wire.&nbsp; What is it?</p>
<p>Film fern, Hymenophyllum.&nbsp; But what are you staring at now,
with all your eyes?</p>
<p>Oh! that rock covered with green stars and a cloud of little white
and pink flowers growing out of them.</p>
<p>Aha! my good little dog!&nbsp; I thought you would stand to that
game when you found it.</p>
<p>What is it, though?</p>
<p>You must answer that yourself.&nbsp; You have seen it a hundred times
before.</p>
<p>Why, it is London Pride, that grows in the garden at home.</p>
<p>Of course it is: but the Irish call it St. Patrick&rsquo;s cabbage;
though it got here a long time before St. Patrick; and St. Patrick must
have been very short of garden-stuff if he ever ate it.</p>
<p>But how did it get here from London?</p>
<p>No, no.&nbsp; How did it get to London from hence?&nbsp; For from
this country it came.&nbsp; I suppose the English brought it home in
Queen Bess&rsquo;s or James the First&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>But if it is wild here, and will grow so well in England, why do
we not find it wild in England too?</p>
<p>For the same reason that there are no toads or snakes in Ireland.&nbsp;
They had not got as far as Ireland before Ireland was parted off from
England.&nbsp; And St. Patrick&rsquo;s cabbage, and a good many other
plants, had not got as far as England.</p>
<p>But why?</p>
<p>Why, I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; But this I know: that when Madam How
makes a new sort of plant or animal, she starts it in one single place,
and leaves it to take care of itself and earn its own living&mdash;as
she does you and me and every one&mdash;and spread from that place all
round as far as it can go.&nbsp; So St. Patrick&rsquo;s cabbage got
into this south-west of Ireland, long, long ago; and was such a brave
sturdy little plant, that it clambered up to the top of the highest
mountains, and over all the rocks.&nbsp; But when it got to the rich
lowlands to the eastward, in county Cork, it found all the ground taken
up already with other plants; and as they had enough to do to live themselves,
they would not let St. Patrick&rsquo;s cabbage settle among them; and
it had to be content with living here in the far-west&mdash;and, what
was very sad, had no means of sending word to its brothers and sisters
in the Pyrenees how it was getting on.</p>
<p>What do you mean?&nbsp; Are you making fun of me?</p>
<p>Not the least.&nbsp; I am only telling you a very strange story,
which is literally true.&nbsp; Come, and sit down on this bench.&nbsp;
You can&rsquo;t catch that great butterfly, he is too strong on the
wing for you.</p>
<p>But oh, what a beautiful one!</p>
<p>Yes, orange and black, silver and green, a glorious creature.&nbsp;
But you may see him at home sometimes: that plant close to you, you
cannot see at home.</p>
<p>Why, it is only great spurge, such as grows in the woods at home.</p>
<p>No.&nbsp; It is Irish spurge which grows here, and sometimes in Devonshire,
and then again in the west of Europe, down to the Pyrenees.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
touch it.&nbsp; Our wood spurge is poisonous enough, but this is worse
still; if you get a drop of its milk on your lip or eye, you will be
in agonies for half a day.&nbsp; That is the evil plant with which the
poachers kill the salmon.</p>
<p>How do they do that?</p>
<p>When the salmon are spawning up in the little brooks, and the water
is low, they take that spurge, and grind it between two stones under
water, and let the milk run down into the pool; and at that all the
poor salmon turn up dead.&nbsp; Then comes the water-bailiff, and catches
the poachers.&nbsp; Then comes the policeman, with his sword at his
side and his truncheon under his arm: and then comes a &ldquo;cheap
journey&rdquo; to Tralee Gaol, in which those foolish poachers sit and
reconsider themselves, and determine not to break the salmon laws&mdash;at
least till next time.</p>
<p>But why is it that this spurge, and St. Patrick&rsquo;s cabbage,
grow only here in the west?&nbsp; If they got here of themselves, where
did they come from?&nbsp; All outside there is sea; and they could not
float over that.</p>
<p>Come, I say, and sit down on this bench, and I will tell you a tale,&mdash;the
story of the Old Atlantis, the sunken land in the far West.&nbsp; Old
Plato, the Greek, told legends of it, which you will read some day;
and now it seems as if those old legends had some truth in them, after
all.&nbsp; We are standing now on one of the last remaining scraps of
the old Atlantic land.&nbsp; Look down the bay.&nbsp; Do you see far
away, under, the mountains, little islands, long and low?</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>Some of these are old slate, like the mountains; others are limestone;
bits of the old coral-reef to the west of Ireland which became dry land.</p>
<p>I know.&nbsp; You told me about it.</p>
<p>Then that land, which is all eaten up by the waves now, once joined
Ireland to Cornwall, and to Spain, and to the Azores, and I suspect
to the Cape of Good Hope, and what is stranger, to Labrador, on the
coast of North America.</p>
<p>Oh!&nbsp; How can you know that?</p>
<p>Listen, and I will give you your first lesson in what I call Bio-geology.</p>
<p>What a long word!</p>
<p>If you can find a shorter one I shall be very much obliged to you,
for I hate long words.&nbsp; But what it means is,&mdash;Telling how
the land has changed in shape, by the plants and animals upon it.&nbsp;
And if you ever read (as you will) Mr. Wallace&rsquo;s new book on the
Indian Archipelago, you will see what wonderful discoveries men may
make about such questions if they will but use their common sense.&nbsp;
You know the common pink heather&mdash;ling, as we call it?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Then that ling grows, not only here and in the north and west of
Europe, but in the Azores too; and, what is more strange, in Labrador.&nbsp;
Now, as ling can neither swim nor fly, does not common sense tell you
that all those countries were probably joined together in old times?</p>
<p>Well: but it seems so strange.</p>
<p>So it is, my child; and so is everything.&nbsp; But, as the fool
says in Shakespeare&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A long time ago the world began,<br />
With heigh ho, the wind and the rain.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the wind and the rain have made strange work with the poor old
world ever since.&nbsp; And that is about all that we, who are not very
much wiser than Shakespeare&rsquo;s fool, can say about the matter.&nbsp;
But again&mdash;the London Pride grows here, and so does another saxifrage
very like it, which we call Saxifraga Geum.&nbsp; Now, when I saw those
two plants growing in the Western Pyrenees, between France and Spain,
and with them the beautiful blue butterwort, which grows in these Kerry
bogs&mdash;we will go and find some&mdash;what could I say but that
Spain and Ireland must have been joined once?</p>
<p>I suppose it must be so.</p>
<p>Again.&nbsp; There is a little pink butterwort here in the bogs,
which grows, too, in dear old Devonshire and Cornwall; and also in the
south-west of Scotland.&nbsp; Now, when I found that too, in the bogs
near Biarritz, close to the Pyrenees, and knew that it stretched away
along the Spanish coast, and into Portugal, what could my common sense
lead me to say but that Scotland, and Ireland, and Cornwall, and Spain
were all joined once?&nbsp; Those are only a few examples.&nbsp; I could
give you a dozen more.&nbsp; For instance, on an island away there to
the west, and only in one spot, there grows a little sort of lily, which
is found I believe in Brittany, and on the Spanish and Portuguese heaths,
and even in North-west Africa.&nbsp; And that Africa and Spain were
joined not so very long ago at the Straits of Gibraltar there is no
doubt at all.</p>
<p>But where did the Mediterranean Sea run out then?</p>
<p>Perhaps it did not run out at all; but was a salt-water lake, like
the Caspian, or the Dead Sea.&nbsp; Perhaps it ran out over what is
now the Sahara, the great desert of sand, for, that was a sea-bottom
not long ago.</p>
<p>But then, how was this land of Atlantis joined to the Cape of Good
Hope?</p>
<p>I cannot say how, or when either.&nbsp; But this is plain: the place
in the world where the most beautiful heaths grow is the Cape of Good
Hope?&nbsp; You know I showed you Cape heaths once at the nursery gardener&rsquo;s
at home.</p>
<p>Oh yes, pink, and yellow, and white; so much larger than ours.</p>
<p>Then it seems (I only say it seems) as if there must have been some
land once to the westward, from which the different sorts of heath spread
south-eastward to the Cape, and north-eastward into Europe.&nbsp; And
that they came north-eastward into Europe seems certain; for there are
no heaths in America or Asia.</p>
<p>But how north-eastward?</p>
<p>Think.&nbsp; Stand with your face to the south and think.&nbsp; If
a thing comes from the south-west&mdash;from there, it must go to the
north-east-towards there.&nbsp; Must it not?</p>
<p>Oh yes, I see.</p>
<p>Now then&mdash;The farther you go south-west, towards Spain, the
more kinds of heath there are, and the handsomer; as if their original
home, from which they started, was somewhere down there.</p>
<p>More sorts!&nbsp; What sorts?</p>
<p>How many sorts of heath have we at home?</p>
<p>Three, of course: ling, and purple heath, and bottle heath.</p>
<p>And there are no more in all England, or Wales, or Scotland, except&mdash;Now,
listen.&nbsp; In the very farthest end of Cornwall there are two more
sorts, the Cornish heath and the Orange-bell; and they say (though I
never saw it) that the Orange-bell grows near Bournemouth.</p>
<p>Well.&nbsp; That is south and west too.</p>
<p>So it is: but that makes five heaths.&nbsp; Now in the south and
west of Ireland all these five heaths grow, and two more: the great
Irish heath, with purple bells, and the Mediterranean heath, which flowers
in spring.</p>
<p>Oh, I know them.&nbsp; They grow in the Rhododendron beds at home.</p>
<p>Of course.&nbsp; Now again.&nbsp; If you went down to Spain, you
would find all those seven heaths, and other sorts with them, and those
which are rare in England and Ireland are common there.&nbsp; About
Biarritz, on the Spanish frontier, all the moors are covered with Cornish
heath, and the bogs with Orange-bell, and lovely they are to see; and
growing among them is a tall heath six feet high, which they call there
<i>bruy&egrave;re</i>, or Broomheath, because they make brooms of it:
and out of its roots the &ldquo;briar-root&rdquo; pipes are made.&nbsp;
There are other heaths about that country, too, whose names I do not
know; so that when you are there, you fancy yourself in the very home
of the heaths: but you are not.&nbsp; They must have come from some
land near where the Azores are now; or how could heaths have got past
Africa, and the tropics, to the Cape of Good Hope?</p>
<p>It seems very wonderful, to be able to find out that there was a
great land once in the ocean all by a few little heaths.</p>
<p>Not by them only, child.&nbsp; There are many other plants, and animals
too, which make one think that so it must have been.&nbsp; And now I
will tell you something stranger still.&nbsp; There may have been a
time&mdash;some people say that there must&mdash;when Africa and South
America were joined by land.</p>
<p>Africa and South America!&nbsp; Was that before the heaths came here,
or after?</p>
<p>I cannot tell: but I think, probably after.&nbsp; But this is certain,
that there must have been a time when figs, and bamboos, and palms,
and sarsaparillas, and many other sorts of plants could get from Africa
to America, or the other way, and indeed almost round the world.&nbsp;
About the south of France and Italy you will see one beautiful sarsaparilla,
with hooked prickles, zigzagging and twining about over rocks and ruins,
trunks and stems: and when you do, if you have understanding, it will
seem as strange to you as it did to me to remember that the home of
the sarsaparillas is not in Europe, but in the forests of Brazil, and
the River Plate.</p>
<p>Oh, I have heard about their growing there, and staining the rivers
brown, and making them good medicine to drink: but I never thought there
were any in Europe.</p>
<p>There are only one or two, and how they got there is a marvel indeed.&nbsp;
But now&mdash;If there was not dry land between Africa and South America,
how did the cats get into America?&nbsp; For they cannot swim.</p>
<p>Cats?&nbsp; People might have brought them over.</p>
<p>Jaguars and Pumas, which you read of in Captain Mayne Reid&rsquo;s
books, are cats, and so are the Ocelots or tiger cats.</p>
<p>Oh, I saw them at the Zoological Gardens.</p>
<p>But no one would bring them over, I should think, except to put them
in the Zoo.</p>
<p>Not unless they were very foolish.</p>
<p>And much stronger and cleverer than the savages of South America.&nbsp;
No, those jaguars and pumus have been in America for ages: and there
are those who will tell you&mdash;and I think they have some reason
on their side&mdash;that the jaguar, with his round patches of spots,
was once very much the same as the African and Indian leopard, who can
climb trees well.&nbsp; So when he got into the tropic forests of America,
he took to the trees, and lived among the branches, feeding on sloths
and monkeys, and never coming to the ground for weeks, till he grew
fatter and stronger and far more terrible than his forefathers.&nbsp;
And they will tell you, too, that the puma was, perhaps&mdash;I only
say perhaps&mdash;something like the lion, who (you know) has no spots.&nbsp;
But when he got into the forests, he found very little food under the
trees, only a very few deer; and so he was starved, and dwindled down
to the poor little sheep-stealing rogue he is now, of whom nobody is
afraid.</p>
<p>Oh, yes!&nbsp; I remember now A. said he and his men killed six in
one day.&nbsp; But do you think it is all true about the pumas and jaguars?</p>
<p>My child, I don&rsquo;t say that it is true: but only that it is
likely to be true.&nbsp; In science we must be cautious and modest,
and ready to alter our minds whenever we learn fresh facts; only keeping
sure of one thing, that the truth, when we find it out, will be far
more wonderful than any notions of ours.&nbsp; See!&nbsp; As we have
been talking we have got nearly home: and luncheon must be ready.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Why are you opening your eyes at me like the dog when he wants to
go out walking?</p>
<p>Because I want to go out.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t want to go out
walking.&nbsp; I want to go in the yacht.</p>
<p>In the yacht?&nbsp; It does not belong to me.</p>
<p>Oh, that is only fun.&nbsp; I know everybody is going out in it to
see such a beautiful island full of ferns, and have a picnic on the
rocks; and I know you are going.</p>
<p>Then you know more than I do myself.</p>
<p>But I heard them say you were going.</p>
<p>Then they know more than I do myself.</p>
<p>But would you not like to go?</p>
<p>I might like to go very much indeed; but as I have been knocked about
at sea a good deal, and perhaps more than I intend to be again, it is
no novelty to me, and there might be other things which I liked still
better: for instance, spending the afternoon with you.</p>
<p>Then am I not to go?</p>
<p>I think not.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t pull such a long face: but be a man,
and make up your mind to it, as the geese do to going barefoot.</p>
<p>But why may I not go?</p>
<p>Because I am not Madam How, but your Daddy.</p>
<p>What can that have to do with it?</p>
<p>If you asked Madam How, do you know what she would answer in a moment,
as civilly and kindly as could be?&nbsp; She would say&mdash;Oh yes,
go by all means, and please yourself, my pretty little man.&nbsp; My
world is the Paradise which the Irishman talked of, in which &ldquo;a
man might do what was right in the sight of his own eyes, and what was
wrong too, as he liked it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Madam How would let me go in the yacht?</p>
<p>Of course she would, or jump overboard when you were in it; or put
your finger in the fire, and your head afterwards; or eat Irish spurge,
and die like the salmon; or anything else you liked.&nbsp; Nobody is
so indulgent as Madam How: and she would be the dearest old lady in
the world, but for one ugly trick that she has.&nbsp; She never tells
any one what is coming, but leaves them to find it out for themselves.&nbsp;
She lets them put their fingers in the fire, and never tells them that
they will get burnt.</p>
<p>But that is very cruel and treacherous of her.</p>
<p>My boy, our business is not to call hard names, but to take things
as we find them, as the Highlandman said when he ate the braxy mutton.&nbsp;
Now shall I, because I am your Daddy, tell you what Madam How would
not have told you?&nbsp; When you get on board the yacht, you will think
it all very pleasant for an hour, as long as you are in the bay.&nbsp;
But presently you will get a little bored, and run about the deck, and
disturb people, and want to sit here, there, and everywhere, which I
should not like.&nbsp; And when you get beyond that headland, you will
find the great rollers coming in from the Atlantic, and the cutter tossing
and heaving as you never felt before, under a burning sun.&nbsp; And
then my merry little young gentleman will begin to feel a little sick;
and then very sick, and more miserable than he ever felt in his life;
and wish a thousand times over that he was safe at home, even doing
sums in long division; and he will give a great deal of trouble to various
kind ladies&mdash;which no one has a right to do, if he can help it.</p>
<p>Of course I do not wish to be sick: only it looks such beautiful
weather.</p>
<p>And so it is: but don&rsquo;t fancy that last night&rsquo;s rain
and wind can have passed without sending in such a swell as will frighten
you, when you see the cutter climbing up one side of a wave, and running
down the other; Madam How tells me that, though she will not tell you
yet.</p>
<p>Then why do they go out?</p>
<p>Because they are accustomed to it.&nbsp; They have come hither all
round from Cowes, past the Land&rsquo;s End, and past Cape Clear, and
they are not afraid or sick either.&nbsp; But shall I tell you how you
would end this evening?&mdash;at least so I suspect.&nbsp; Lying miserable
in a stuffy cabin, on a sofa, and not quite sure whether you were dead
or alive, till you were bundled into a boat about twelve o&rsquo;clock
at night, when you ought to be safe asleep, and come home cold, and
wet, and stupid, and ill, and lie in bed all to-morrow.</p>
<p>But will they be wet and cold?</p>
<p>I cannot be sure; but from the look of the sky there to westward,
I think some of them will be.&nbsp; So do you make up your mind to stay
with me.&nbsp; But if it is fine and smooth to-morrow, perhaps we may
row down the bay, and see plenty of wonderful things.</p>
<p>But why is it that Madam How will not tell people beforehand what
will happen to them, as you have told me?</p>
<p>Now I will tell you a great secret, which, alas! every one has not
found out yet.&nbsp; Madam How will teach you, but only by experience.&nbsp;
Lady Why will teach you, but by something very different&mdash;by something
which has been called&mdash;and I know no better names for it&mdash;grace
and inspiration; by putting into your heart feelings which no man, not
even your father and mother, can put there; by making you quick to love
what is right, and hate what is wrong, simply because they are right
and wrong, though you don&rsquo;t know why they are right and wrong;
by making you teachable, modest, reverent, ready to believe those who
are older and wiser than you when they tell you what you could never
find out for yourself: and so you will be prudent, that is provident,
foreseeing, and know what will happen if you do so-and-so; and therefore
what is really best and wisest for you.</p>
<p>But why will she be kind enough to do that for me?</p>
<p>For the very same reason that I do it.&nbsp; For God&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp;
Because God is your Father in heaven, as I am your father on earth,
and He does not wish His little child to be left to the hard teaching
of Nature and Law, but to be helped on by many, many unsought and undeserved
favours, such as are rightly called &ldquo;Means of Grace;&rdquo; and
above all by the Gospel and good news that you are God&rsquo;s child,
and that God loves you, and has helped and taught you, and will help
you and teach you, in a thousand ways of which you are not aware, if
only you will be a wise child, and listen to Lady Why, when she cries
from her Palace of Wisdom, and the feast which she has prepared, &ldquo;Whoso
is simple let him turn in hither;&rdquo; and says to him who wants understanding&mdash;&ldquo;Come,
eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have
strength.&nbsp; By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.&nbsp;
By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.&nbsp;
I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.&nbsp;
Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, I will try and listen to Lady Why: but what will happen if I
do not?</p>
<p>That will happen to you, my child&mdash;but God forbid it ever should
happen&mdash;which happens to wicked kings and rulers, and all men,
even the greatest and cleverest, if they do not choose to reign by Lady
Why&rsquo;s laws, and decree justice according to her eternal ideas
of what is just, but only do what seems pleasant and profitable to themselves.&nbsp;
On them Lady Why turns round, and says&mdash;for she, too, can be awful,
ay dreadful, when she needs&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out
my hand, and no man regarded; but ye have set at nought all my counsel,
and would have none of my reproof&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; And then come
words so terrible, that I will not speak them here in this happy place:
but what they mean is this:&mdash;</p>
<p>That these foolish people are handed over&mdash;as you and I shall
be if we do wrong wilfully&mdash;to Madam How and her terrible school-house,
which is called Nature and the Law, to be treated just as the plants
and animals are treated, because they did not choose to behave like
men and children of God.&nbsp; And there they learn, whether they like
or not, what they might have learnt from Lady Why all along.&nbsp; They
learn the great law, that as men sow so they will reap; as they make
their bed so they will lie on it: and Madam How can teach that as no
one else can in earth or heaven: only, unfortunately for her scholars,
she is apt to hit so hard with her rod, which is called Experience,
that they never get over it; and therefore most of those who will only
be taught by Nature and Law are killed, poor creatures, before they
have learnt their lesson; as many a savage tribe is destroyed, ay and
great and mighty nations too&mdash;the old Roman Empire among them.</p>
<p>And the poor Jews, who were carried away captive to Babylon?</p>
<p>Yes; they would not listen to Lady Why, and so they were taken in
hand by Madam How, and were seventy years in her terrible school-house,
learning a lesson which, to do them justice, they never forgot again.&nbsp;
But now we will talk of something pleasanter.&nbsp; We will go back
to Lady Why, and listen to her voice.&nbsp; It sounds gentle and cheerful
enough just now.&nbsp; Listen.</p>
<p>What? is she speaking to us now?</p>
<p>Hush! open your eyes and ears once more, for you are growing sleepy
with my long sermon.&nbsp; Watch the sleepy shining water, and the sleepy
green mountains.&nbsp; Listen to the sleepy lapping of the ripple, and
the sleepy sighing of the woods, and let Lady Why talk to you through
them in &ldquo;songs without words,&rdquo; because they are deeper than
all words, till you, too, fall asleep with your head upon my knee.</p>
<p>But what does she say?</p>
<p>She says&mdash;&ldquo;Be still.&nbsp; The fulness of joy is peace.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There, you are fast asleep; and perhaps that is the best thing for you;
for sleep will (so I am informed, though I never saw it happen, nor
any one else) put fresh gray matter into your brain; or save the wear
and tear of the old gray matter; or something else&mdash;when they have
settled what it is to do: and if so, you will wake up with a fresh fiddle-string
to your little fiddle of a brain, on which you are playing new tunes
all day long.&nbsp; So much the better: but when I believe that your
brain is you, pretty boy, then I shall believe also that the fiddler
is his fiddle.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII&mdash;HOMEWARD BOUND</h2>
<p>Come: I suppose you consider yourself quite a good sailor by now?</p>
<p>Oh, yes.&nbsp; I have never been ill yet, though it has been quite
rough again and again.</p>
<p>What you call rough, little man.&nbsp; But as you are grown such
a very good sailor, and also as the sea is all but smooth, I think we
will have a sail in the yacht to-day, and that a tolerably long one.</p>
<p>Oh, how delightful! but I thought we were going home; and the things
are all packed up.</p>
<p>And why should we not go homewards in the yacht, things and all?</p>
<p>What, all the way to England?</p>
<p>No, not so far as that; but these kind people, when they came into
the harbour last night, offered to take us up the coast to a town, where
we will sleep, and start comfortably home to-morrow morning.&nbsp; So
now you will have a chance of seeing something of the great sea outside,
and of seeing, perhaps, the whale himself.</p>
<p>I hope we shall see the whale.&nbsp; The men say he has been outside
the harbour every day this week after the fish.</p>
<p>Very good.&nbsp; Now do you keep quiet, and out of the way, while
we are getting ready to go on board; and take a last look at this pretty
place, and all its dear kind people.</p>
<p>And the dear kind dogs too, and the cat and the kittens.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Now, come along, and bundle into the boat, if you have done bidding
every one good-bye; and take care you don&rsquo;t slip down in the ice-groovings,
as you did the other day.&nbsp; There, we are off at last.</p>
<p>Oh, look at them all on the rock watching us and waving their handkerchiefs;
and Harper and Paddy too, and little Jimsy and Isy, with their fat bare
feet, and their arms round the dogs&rsquo; necks.&nbsp; I am so sorry
to leave them all.</p>
<p>Not sorry to go home?</p>
<p>No, but&mdash;They have been so kind; and the dogs were so kind.&nbsp;
I am sure they knew we were going, and were sorry too.</p>
<p>Perhaps they were.&nbsp; They knew we were going away, at all events.&nbsp;
They know what bringing out boxes and luggage means well enough.</p>
<p>Sam knew, I am sure; but he did not care for us.&nbsp; He was only
uneasy because he thought Harper was going, and he should lose his shooting;
and as soon as he saw Harper was not getting into the boat, he sat down
and scratched himself, quite happy.&nbsp; But do dogs think?</p>
<p>Of course they do, only they do not think in words, as we do.</p>
<p>But how can they think without words?</p>
<p>That is very difficult for you and me to imagine, because we always
think in words.&nbsp; They must think in pictures, I suppose, by remembering
things which have happened to them.&nbsp; You and I do that in our dreams.&nbsp;
I suspect that savages, who have very few words to express their thoughts
with, think in pictures, like their own dogs.&nbsp; But that is a long
story.&nbsp; We must see about getting on board now, and under way.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Well, and what have you been doing?</p>
<p>Oh, I looked all over the yacht, at the ropes and curious things;
and then I looked at the mountains, till I was tired; and then I heard
you and some gentleman talking about the land sinking, and I listened.&nbsp;
There was no harm in that?</p>
<p>None at all.&nbsp; But what did you hear him say?</p>
<p>That the land must be sinking here, because there were peat-bogs
everywhere below high-water mark.&nbsp; Is that true?</p>
<p>Quite true; and that peat would never have been formed where the
salt water could get at it, as it does now every tide.</p>
<p>But what was it he said about that cliff over there?</p>
<p>He said that cliff on our right, a hundred feet high, was plainly
once joined on to that low island on our left.</p>
<p>What, that long bank of stones, with a house on it?</p>
<p>That is no house.&nbsp; That is a square lump of mud, the last remaining
bit of earth which was once the moraine of a glacier.&nbsp; Every year
it crumbles into the sea more and more; and in a few years it will be
all gone, and nothing left but the great round boulder-stones which
the ice brought down from the glaciers behind us.</p>
<p>But how does he know that it was once joined to the cliff?</p>
<p>Because that cliff, and the down behind it, where the cows are fed,
is made up, like the island, of nothing but loose earth and stones;
and that is why it is bright and green beside the gray rocks and brown
heather of the moors at its foot.&nbsp; He knows that it must be an
old glacier moraine; and he has reason to think that moraine once stretched
right across the bay to the low island, and perhaps on to the other
shore, and was eaten out by the sea as the land sank down.</p>
<p>But how does he know that the land sank?</p>
<p>Of that, he says, he is quite certain; and this is what he says.&mdash;Suppose
there was a glacier here, where we are sailing now: it would end in
an ice cliff, such as you have seen a picture of in Captain Cook&rsquo;s
Voyages, of which you are so fond.&nbsp; You recollect the pictures
of Christmas Sound and Possession Bay?</p>
<p>Oh yes, and pictures of Greenland and Spitzbergen too, with glaciers
in the sea.</p>
<p>Then icebergs would break off from that cliff, and carry all the
dirt and stones out to sea, perhaps hundreds of miles away, instead
of letting it drop here in a heap; and what did fall in a heap here
the sea would wash down at once, and smooth it over the sea-bottom,
and never let it pile up in a huge bank like that.&nbsp; Do you understand?</p>
<p>I think I do.</p>
<p>Therefore, he says, that great moraine must have been built upon
dry land, in the open air; and must have sunk since into the sea, which
is gnawing at it day and night, and will some day eat it all up, as
it would eat up all the dry land in the world, if Madam How was not
continually lifting up fresh land, to make up for what the sea has carried
off.</p>
<p>Oh, look there! some one has caught a fish, and is hauling it up.&nbsp;
What a strange creature!&nbsp; It is not a mackerel, nor a gurnet, nor
a pollock.</p>
<p>How do you know that?</p>
<p>Why, it is running along the top of the water like a snake; and they
never do that.&nbsp; Here it comes.&nbsp; It has got a long beak, like
a snipe.&nbsp; Oh, let me see.</p>
<p>See if you like: but don&rsquo;t get in the way.&nbsp; Remember you
are but a little boy.</p>
<p>What is it? a snake with a bird&rsquo;s head?</p>
<p>No: a snake has no fins; and look at its beak: it is full of little
teeth, which no bird has.&nbsp; But a very curious fellow he is, nevertheless:
and his name is Gar-fish.&nbsp; Some call him Green-bone, because his
bones are green.</p>
<p>But what kind of fish is he?&nbsp; He is like nothing I ever saw.</p>
<p>I believe he is nearest to a pike, though his backbone is different
from a pike, and from all other known fishes.</p>
<p>But is he not very rare?</p>
<p>Oh no: he comes to Devonshire and Cornwall with the mackerel, as
he has come here; and in calm weather he will swim on the top of the
water, and play about, and catch flies, and stand bolt upright with
his long nose in the air; and when the fisher-boys throw him a stick,
he will jump over it again and again, and play with it in the most ridiculous
way.</p>
<p>And what will they do with him?</p>
<p>Cut him up for bait, I suppose, for he is not very good to eat.</p>
<p>Certainly, he does smell very nasty.</p>
<p>Have you only just found out that?&nbsp; Sometimes when I have caught
one, he has made the boat smell so that I was glad to throw him overboard,
and so he saved his life by his nastiness.&nbsp; But they will catch
plenty of mackerel now; for where he is they are; and where they are,
perhaps the whale will be; for we are now well outside the harbour,
and running across the open bay; and lucky for you that there are no
rollers coming in from the Atlantic, and spouting up those cliffs in
columns of white foam.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah!&nbsp; Who was that coughed just behind the ship?</p>
<p>Who, indeed? look round and see.</p>
<p>There is nobody.&nbsp; There could not be in the sea.</p>
<p>Look&mdash;there, a quarter of a mile away.</p>
<p>Oh!&nbsp; What is that turning over in the water, like a great black
wheel?&nbsp; And a great tooth on it, and&mdash;oh! it is gone!</p>
<p>Never mind.&nbsp; It will soon show itself again.</p>
<p>But what was it?</p>
<p>The whale: one of them, at least; for the men say there are two different
ones about the bay.&nbsp; That black wheel was part of his back, as
he turned down; and the tooth on it was his back-fin.</p>
<p>But the noise, like a giant&rsquo;s cough?</p>
<p>Rather like the blast of a locomotive just starting.&nbsp; That was
his breath.</p>
<p>What? as loud as that?</p>
<p>Why not?&nbsp; He is a very big fellow, and has big lungs.</p>
<p>How big is he?</p>
<p>I cannot say: perhaps thirty or forty feet long.&nbsp; We shall be
able to see better soon.&nbsp; He will come up again, and very likely
nearer us, where those birds are.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want him to come any nearer.</p>
<p>You really need not be afraid.&nbsp; He is quite harmless.</p>
<p>But he might run against the yacht.</p>
<p>He might: and so might a hundred things happen which never do.&nbsp;
But I never heard of one of these whales running against a vessel; so
I suppose he has sense enough to know that the yacht is no concern of
his, and to keep out of its way.</p>
<p>But why does he make that tremendous noise only once, and then go
under water again?</p>
<p>You must remember that he is not a fish.&nbsp; A fish takes the water
in through his mouth continually, and it runs over his gills, and out
behind through his gill-covers.&nbsp; So the gills suck-up the air out
of the water, and send it into the fish&rsquo;s blood, just as they
do in the newt-larva.</p>
<p>Yes, I know.</p>
<p>But the whale breathes with lungs like you and me; and when he goes
under water he has to hold his breath, as you and I have.</p>
<p>What a long time he can hold it.</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; He is a wonderful diver.&nbsp; Some whales, they say,
will keep under for an hour.&nbsp; But while he is under, mind, the
air in his lungs is getting foul, and full of carbonic acid, just as
it would in your lungs, if you held your breath.&nbsp; So he is forced
to come up at last: and then out of his blowers, which are on the top
of his head, he blasts out all the foul breath, and with it the water
which has got into his mouth, in a cloud of spray.&nbsp; Then he sucks
in fresh air, as much as he wants, and dives again, as you saw him do
just now.</p>
<p>And what does he do under water?</p>
<p>Look&mdash;and you will see.&nbsp; Look at those birds.&nbsp; We
will sail up to them; for Mr. Whale will probably rise among them soon.</p>
<p>Oh, what a screaming and what a fighting!&nbsp; How many sorts there
are!&nbsp; What are those beautiful little ones, like great white swallows,
with crested heads and forked tails, who hover, and then dip down and
pick up something?</p>
<p>Terns&mdash;sea-swallows.&nbsp; And there are gulls in hundreds,
you see, large and small, gray-backed and black-backed; and over them
all two or three great gannets swooping round and round.</p>
<p>Oh! one has fallen into the sea!</p>
<p>Yes, with a splash just like a cannon ball.&nbsp; And here he comes
up again, with a fish in his beak.&nbsp; If he had fallen on your head,
with that beak of his, he would have split it open.&nbsp; I have heard
of men catching gannets by tying a fish on a board, and letting it float;
and when the gannet strikes at it he drives his bill into the board,
and cannot get it out.</p>
<p>But is not that cruel?</p>
<p>I think so.&nbsp; Gannets are of no use, for eating, or anything
else.</p>
<p>What a noise!&nbsp; It is quite deafening.&nbsp; And what are those
black birds about, who croak like crows, or parrots?</p>
<p>Look at them.&nbsp; Some have broad bills, with a white stripe on
it, and cry something like the moor-hens at home.&nbsp; Those are razor-bills.</p>
<p>And what are those who say &ldquo;marrock,&rdquo; something like
a parrot?</p>
<p>The ones with thin bills? they are guillemots, &ldquo;murres&rdquo;
as we call them in Devon: but in some places they call them &ldquo;marrocks,&rdquo;
from what they say.</p>
<p>And each has a little baby bird swimming behind it.&nbsp; Oh! there:
the mother has cocked up her tail and dived, and the little one is swimming
about looking for her!&nbsp; How it cries!&nbsp; It is afraid of the
yacht.</p>
<p>And there she comes up again, and cries &ldquo;marrock&rdquo; to
call it.</p>
<p>Look at it swimming up to her, and cuddling to her, quite happy.</p>
<p>Quite happy.&nbsp; And do you not think that any one who took a gun
and shot either that mother or that child would be both cowardly and
cruel?</p>
<p>But they might eat them.</p>
<p>These sea-birds are not good to eat.&nbsp; They taste too strong
of fish-oil.&nbsp; They are of no use at all, except that the gulls&rsquo;
and terns&rsquo; feathers are put into girls&rsquo; hats.</p>
<p>Well they might find plenty of other things to put in their hats.</p>
<p>So I think.&nbsp; Yes: it would be very cruel, very cruel indeed,
to do what some do, shoot at these poor things, and leave them floating
about wounded till they die.&nbsp; But I suppose, if one gave them one&rsquo;s
mind about such doings, and threatened to put the new Sea Fowl Act in
force against them, and fine them, and show them up in the newspapers,
they would say they meant no harm, and had never thought about its being
cruel.</p>
<p>Then they ought to think.</p>
<p>They ought; and so ought you.&nbsp; Half the cruelty in the world,
like half the misery, comes simply from people&rsquo;s not thinking;
and boys are often very cruel from mere thoughtlessness.&nbsp; So when
you are tempted to rob birds&rsquo; nests, or to set the dogs on a moorhen,
or pelt wrens in the hedge, think; and say&mdash;How should I like that
to be done to me?</p>
<p>I know: but what are all the birds doing?</p>
<p>Look at the water, how it sparkles.&nbsp; It is alive with tiny fish,
&ldquo;fry,&rdquo; &ldquo;brett&rdquo; as we call them in the West,
which the mackerel are driving up to the top.</p>
<p>Poor little things!&nbsp; How hard on them!&nbsp; The big fish at
them from below, and the birds at them from above.&nbsp; And what is
that?&nbsp; Thousands of fish leaping out of the water, scrambling over
each other&rsquo;s backs.&nbsp; What a curious soft rushing roaring
noise they make!</p>
<p>Aha!&nbsp; The eaters are going to be eaten in turn.&nbsp; Those
are the mackerel themselves; and I suspect they see Mr. Whale, and are
scrambling out of the way as fast as they can, lest he should swallow
them down, a dozen at a time.&nbsp; Look out sharp for him now.</p>
<p>I hope he will not come very near.</p>
<p>No.&nbsp; The fish are going from us and past us.&nbsp; If he comes
up, he will come up astern of us, so look back.&nbsp; There he is!</p>
<p>That?&nbsp; I thought it was a boat.</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; He does look very like a boat upside down.&nbsp; But that
is only his head and shoulders.&nbsp; He will blow next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh!&nbsp; What a jet of spray, like the Geysers!&nbsp; And the sun
made a rainbow on the top of it.&nbsp; He is quite still now.</p>
<p>Yes; he is taking a long breath or two.&nbsp; You need not hold my
hand so tight.&nbsp; His head is from us; and when he goes down he will
go right away.</p>
<p>Oh, he is turning head over heels!&nbsp; There is his back fin again.&nbsp;
And&mdash;Ah! was that not a slap!&nbsp; How the water boiled and foamed;
and what a tail he had!&nbsp; And how the mackerel flew out of the water!</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; You are a lucky boy to have seen that.&nbsp; I have not
seen one of those gentlemen show his &ldquo;flukes,&rdquo; as they call
them, since I was a boy on the Cornish coast.</p>
<p>Where is he gone?</p>
<p>Hunting mackerel, away out at sea.&nbsp; But did you notice something
odd about his tail, as you call it&mdash;though it is really none?</p>
<p>It looked as if it was set on flat, and not upright, like a fish&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
But why is it not a tail?</p>
<p>Just because it is set on flat, not upright: and learned men will
tell you that those two flukes are the &ldquo;rudiments&rdquo;&mdash;that
is, either the beginning, or more likely the last remains&mdash;of two
hind feet.&nbsp; But that belongs to the second volume of Madam How&rsquo;s
Book of Kind; and you have not yet learned any of the first volume,
you know, except about a few butterflies.&nbsp; Look here!&nbsp; Here
are more whales coming.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be frightened.&nbsp; They
are only little ones, mackerel-hunting, like the big one.</p>
<p>What pretty smooth things, turning head over heels, and saying, &ldquo;Hush,
Hush!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t really turn clean over; and that &ldquo;Hush&rdquo;
is their way of breathing.</p>
<p>Are they the young ones of that great monster?</p>
<p>No; they are porpoises.&nbsp; That big one is, I believe, a bottle-nose.&nbsp;
But if you want to know about the kinds of whales, you must ask Dr.
Flower at the Royal College of Surgeons, and not me: and he will tell
you wonderful things about them.&mdash;How some of them have mouths
full of strong teeth, like these porpoises; and others, like the great
sperm whale in the South Sea, have huge teeth in their lower jaws, and
in the upper only holes into which those teeth fit; others like the
bottle-nose, only two teeth or so in the lower jaw; and others, like
the narwhal, two straight tusks in the upper jaw, only one of which
grows, and is what you call a narwhal&rsquo;s horn.</p>
<p>Oh yes.&nbsp; I know of a walking-stick made of one.</p>
<p>And strangest of all, how the right-whales have a few little teeth
when they are born, which never come through the gums; but, instead,
they grow all along their gums, an enormous curtain of clotted hair,
which serves as a net to keep in the tiny sea-animals on which they
feed, and let the water strain out.</p>
<p>You mean whalebone?&nbsp; Is whalebone hair?</p>
<p>So it seems.&nbsp; And so is a rhinoceros&rsquo;s horn.&nbsp; A rhinoceros
used to be hairy all over in old times: but now he carries all his hair
on the end of his nose, except a few bristles on his tail.&nbsp; And
the right-whale, not to be done in oddity, carries all his on his gums.</p>
<p>But have no whales any hair?</p>
<p>No real whales: but the Manati, which is very nearly a whale, has
long bristly hair left.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you remember M.&rsquo;s letter
about the one he saw at Rio Janeiro?</p>
<p>This is all very funny: but what is the use of knowing so much about
things&rsquo; teeth and hair?</p>
<p>What is the use of learning Latin and Greek, and a dozen things more
which you have to learn?&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know yet: but wiser people
than you tell you that they will be of use some day.&nbsp; And I can
tell you, that if you would only study that gar-fish long enough, and
compare him with another fish something like him, who has a long beak
to his lower jaw, and none to his upper&mdash;and how he eats I cannot
guess,&mdash;and both of them again with certain fishes like them, which
M. Agassiz has found lately, not in the sea, but in the river Amazon;
and then think carefully enough over their bones and teeth, and their
history from the time they are hatched&mdash;why, you would find out,
I believe, a story about the river Amazon itself, more wonderful than
all the fairy tales you ever read.</p>
<p>Now there is luncheon ready.&nbsp; Come down below, and don&rsquo;t
tumble down the companion-stairs; and by the time you have eaten your
dinner we shall be very near the shore.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>So?&nbsp; Here is my little man on deck, after a good night&rsquo;s
rest.&nbsp; And he has not been the least sick, I hear.</p>
<p>Not a bit: but the cabin was so stuffy and hot, I asked leave to
come on deck.&nbsp; What a huge steamer!&nbsp; But I do not like it
as well as the yacht.&nbsp; It smells of oil and steam, and&mdash;</p>
<p>And pigs and bullocks too, I am sorry to say.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t go
forward above them, but stay here with me, and look round.</p>
<p>Where are we now?&nbsp; What are those high hills, far away to the
left, above the lowlands and woods?</p>
<p>Those are the shore of the Old World&mdash;the Welsh mountains.</p>
<p>And in front of us I can see nothing but flat land.&nbsp; Where is
that?</p>
<p>That is the mouth of the Severn and Avon; where we shall be in half
an hour more.</p>
<p>And there, on the right, over the low hills, I can see higher ones,
blue and hazy.</p>
<p>Those are an island of the Old World, called now the Mendip Hills;
and we are steaming along the great strait between the Mendips and the
Welsh mountains, which once was coral reef, and is now the Severn sea;
and by the time you have eaten your breakfast we shall steam in through
a crack in that coral-reef; and you will see what you missed seeing
when you went to Ireland, because you went on board at night.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Oh!&nbsp; Where have we got to now?&nbsp; Where is the wide Severn
Sea?</p>
<p>Two or three miles beyond us; and here we are in narrow little Avon.</p>
<p>Narrow indeed.&nbsp; I wonder that the steamer does not run against
those rocks.&nbsp; But how beautiful they are, and how the trees hang
down over the water, and are all reflected in it!</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; The gorge of the Avon is always lovely.&nbsp; I saw it
first when I was a little boy like you; and I have seen it many a time
since, in sunshine and in storm, and thought it more lovely every time.&nbsp;
Look! there is something curious.</p>
<p>What?&nbsp; Those great rusty rings fixed into the rock?</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; Those may be as old, for aught I know, as Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s
or James&rsquo;s reign.</p>
<p>But why were they put there?</p>
<p>For ships to hold on by, if they lost the tide.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>It is high tide now.&nbsp; That is why the water is almost up to
the branches of the trees.&nbsp; But when the tide turns, it will all
rush out in a torrent which would sweep ships out to sea again, if they
had not steam, as we have, to help them up against the stream.&nbsp;
So sailing ships, in old times, fastened themselves to those rings,
and rode against the stream till the tide turned, and carried them up
to Bristol.</p>
<p>But what is the tide?&nbsp; And why does it go up and down?&nbsp;
And why does it alter with the moon, as I heard you all saying so often
in Ireland?</p>
<p>That is a long story, which I must tell you something about some
other time.&nbsp; Now I want you to look at something else: and that
is, the rocks themselves, in which the rings are.&nbsp; They are very
curious in my eyes, and very valuable; for they taught me a lesson in
geology when I was quite a boy: and I want them to teach it to you now.</p>
<p>What is there curious in them?</p>
<p>This.&nbsp; You will soon see for yourself, even from the steamer&rsquo;s
deck, that they are not the same rock as the high limestone hills above.&nbsp;
They are made up of red sand and pebbles; and they are a whole world
younger, indeed some say two worlds younger, than the limestone hills
above, and lie upon the top of the limestone.&nbsp; Now you may see
what I meant when I said that the newer rocks, though they lie on the
top of the older, were often lower down than they are.</p>
<p>But how do you know that they lie on the limestone?</p>
<p>Look into that corner of the river, as we turn round, and you will
see with your own eyes.&nbsp; There are the sandstones, lying flat on
the turned-up edges of another rock.</p>
<p>Yes; I see.&nbsp; The layers of it are almost upright.</p>
<p>Then that upright rock underneath is part of the great limestone
hill above.&nbsp; So the hill must have been raised out of the sea,
ages ago, and eaten back by the waves; and then the sand and pebbles
made a beach at its foot, and hardened into stone; and there it is.&nbsp;
And when you get through the limestone hills to Bristol, you will see
more of these same red sandstone rocks, spread about at the foot of
the limestone-hills, on the other side.</p>
<p>But why is the sandstone two worlds newer than the limestone?</p>
<p>Because between that sandstone and that limestone come hundreds of
feet of rock, which carry in them all the coal in England.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
you remember that I told you that once before?</p>
<p>Oh yes.&nbsp; But I see no coal between them there.</p>
<p>No.&nbsp; But there is plenty of coal between them over in Wales;
and plenty too between them on the other side of Bristol.&nbsp; What
you are looking at there is just the lip of a great coal-box, where
the bottom and the lid join.&nbsp; The bottom is the mountain limestone;
and the lid is the new red sandstone, or Trias, as they call it now:
but the coal you cannot see.&nbsp; It is stowed inside the box, miles
away from here.&nbsp; But now, look at the cliffs and the downs, which
(they tell me) are just like the downs in the Holy Land; and the woods
and villas, high over your head.</p>
<p>And what is that in the air?&nbsp; A bridge?</p>
<p>Yes&mdash;that is the famous Suspension Bridge&mdash;and a beautiful
work of art it is.&nbsp; Ay, stare at it, and wonder at it, little man,
of course.</p>
<p>But is it not wonderful?</p>
<p>Yes: it was a clever trick to get those chains across the gulf, high
up in the air: but not so clever a trick as to make a single stone of
which those piers are built, or a single flower or leaf in those woods.&nbsp;
The more you see of Madam How&rsquo;s masonry and carpentry, the clumsier
man&rsquo;s work will look to you.&nbsp; But now we must get ready to
give up our tickets, and go ashore, and settle ourselves in the train;
and then we shall have plenty to see as we run home; more curious, to
my mind, than any suspension bridge.</p>
<p>And you promised to show me all the different rocks and soils as
we went home, because it was so dark when we came from Reading.</p>
<p>Very good.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Now we are settled in the train.&nbsp; And what do you want to know
first?</p>
<p>More about the new rocks being lower than the old ones, though they
lie on the top of them.</p>
<p>Well, look here, at this sketch.</p>
<p>A boy piling up slates?&nbsp; What has that to do with it?</p>
<p>I saw you in Ireland piling slates against a rock just in this way.&nbsp;
And I thought to myself&mdash;&ldquo;That is something like Madam How&rsquo;s
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Why, see.&nbsp; The old rock stands for the mountains of the Old
World, like the Welsh mountains, or the Mendip Hills.&nbsp; The slates
stand for the new rocks, which have been piled up against these, one
over the other.&nbsp; But, you see, each slate is lower than the one
before it, and slopes more; till the last slate which you are putting
on is the lowest of all, though it overlies all.</p>
<p>I see now.&nbsp; I see now.</p>
<p>Then look at the sketch of the rocks between this and home.&nbsp;
It is only a rough sketch, of course: but it will make you understand
something more about the matter.&nbsp; Now.&nbsp; You see, the lump
marked A.&nbsp; With twisted lines in it.&nbsp; That stands for the
Mendip Hills to the west, which are made of old red sandstone, very
much the same rock (to speak roughly) as the Kerry mountains.</p>
<p>And why are the lines in it twisted?</p>
<p>To show that the strata, the layers in it, are twisted, and set up
at quite different angles from the limestone.</p>
<p>But how was that done?</p>
<p>By old earthquakes and changes which happened in old worlds, ages
on ages since.&nbsp; Then the edges of the old red sandstone were eaten
away by the sea&mdash;and some think by ice too, in some earlier age
of ice; and then the limestone coral reef was laid down on them, &ldquo;unconformably,&rdquo;
as geologists say&mdash;just as you saw the new red sandstone laid down
on the edges of the limestone; and so one world is built up on the edge
of another world, out of its scraps and ruins.</p>
<p>Then do you see B.&nbsp; With a notch in it?&nbsp; That means these
limestone hills on the shoulder of the Mendips; and that notch is the
gorge of the Avon which we have steamed through.</p>
<p>And what is that black above it?</p>
<p>That is the coal, a few miles off, marked C.</p>
<p>And what is this D, which comes next?</p>
<p>That is what we are on now.&nbsp; New red sandstone, lying unconformably
on the coal.&nbsp; I showed it you in the bed of the river, as we came
along in the cab.&nbsp; We are here in a sort of amphitheatre, or half
a one, with the limestone hills around us, and the new red sandstone
plastered on, as it were, round the bottom of it inside.</p>
<p>But what is this high bit with E against it?</p>
<p>Those are the high hills round Bath, which we shall run through soon.&nbsp;
They are newer than the soil here; and they are (for an exception) higher
too; for they are so much harder than the soil here, that the sea has
not eaten them away, as it has all the lowlands from Bristol right into
the Somersetshire flats.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>There.&nbsp; We are off at last, and going to run home to Reading,
through one of the loveliest lines (as I think) of old England.&nbsp;
And between the intervals of eating fruit, we will geologize on the
way home, with this little bit of paper to show us where we are.</p>
<p>What pretty rocks!</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; They are a boss of the coal measures, I believe, shoved
up with the lias, the lias lying round them.&nbsp; But I warn you I
may not be quite right: because I never looked at a geological map of
this part of the line, and have learnt what I know, just as I want you
to learn simply by looking out of the carriage window.</p>
<p>Look.&nbsp; Here is lias rock in the side of the cutting; layers
of hard blue limestone, and then layers of blue mud between them, in
which, if you could stop to look, you would find fossils in plenty;
and along that lias we shall run to Bath, and then all the rocks will
change.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Now, here we are at Bath; and here are the handsome fruit-women,
waiting for you to buy.</p>
<p>And oh, what strawberries and cherries!</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; All this valley is very rich, and very sheltered too,
and very warm; for the soft south-western air sweeps up it from the
Bristol Channel; so the slopes are covered with fruit-orchards, as you
will see as you get out of the station.</p>
<p>Why, we are above the tops of the houses.</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; We have been rising ever since we left Bristol; and you
will soon see why.&nbsp; Now we have laid in as much fruit as is safe
for you, and away we go.</p>
<p>Oh, what high hills over the town!&nbsp; And what beautiful stone
houses!&nbsp; Even the cottages are built of stone.</p>
<p>All that stone comes out of those high hills, into which we are going
now.&nbsp; It is called Bath-stone freestone, or oolite; and it lies
on the top of the lias, which we have just left.&nbsp; Here it is marked
F.</p>
<p>What steep hills, and cliffs too, and with quarries in them!&nbsp;
What can have made them so steep?&nbsp; And what can have made this
little narrow valley?</p>
<p>Madam How&rsquo;s rain-spade from above, I suppose, and perhaps the
sea gnawing at their feet below.&nbsp; Those freestone hills once stretched
high over our heads, and far away, I suppose, to the westward.&nbsp;
Now they are all gnawed out into cliffs,&mdash;indeed gnawed clean through
in the bottom of the valley, where the famous hot springs break out
in which people bathe.</p>
<p>Is that why the place is called Bath?</p>
<p>Of course.&nbsp; But the Old Romans called the place Aqu&aelig; Solis&mdash;the
waters of the sun; and curious old Roman remains are found here, which
we have not time to stop and see.</p>
<p>Now look out at the pretty clear limestone stream running to meet
us below, and the great limestone hills closing over us above.&nbsp;
How do you think we shall get out from among them?</p>
<p>Shall we go over their tops?</p>
<p>No.&nbsp; That would be too steep a climb, for even such a great
engine as this.</p>
<p>Then there is a crack which we can get through?</p>
<p>Look and see.</p>
<p>Why, we are coming to a regular wall of hill, and&mdash;</p>
<p>And going right through it in the dark.&nbsp; We are in the Box Tunnel.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>There is the light again: and now I suppose you will find your tongue.</p>
<p>How long it seemed before we came out!</p>
<p>Yes, because you were waiting and watching, with nothing to look
at: but the tunnel is only a mile and a quarter long after all, I believe.&nbsp;
If you had been looking at fields and hedgerows all the while, you would
have thought no time at all had passed.</p>
<p>What curious sandy rocks on each side of the cutting, in lines and
layers.</p>
<p>Those are the freestone still: and full of fossils they are.&nbsp;
But do you see that they dip away from us?&nbsp; Remember that.&nbsp;
All the rocks are sloping eastward, the way we are going; and each new
rock or soil we come to lies on the top of the one before it.&nbsp;
Now we shall run down hill for many a mile, down the back of the oolites,
past pretty Chippenham, and Wootton-Bassett, towards Swindon spire.&nbsp;
Look at the country, child; and thank God for this fair English land,
in which your lot is cast.</p>
<p>What beautiful green fields; and such huge elm trees; and orchards;
and flowers in the cottage gardens!</p>
<p>Ay, and what crops, too: what wheat and beans, turnips and mangold.&nbsp;
All this land is very rich and easily worked; and hereabouts is some
of the best farming in England.&nbsp; The Agricultural College at Cirencester,
of which you have so often heard, lies thereaway, a few miles to our
left; and there lads go to learn to farm as no men in the world, save
English and Scotch, know how to farm.</p>
<p>But what rock are we on now?</p>
<p>On rock that is much softer than that on the other side of the oolite
hills: much softer, because it is much newer.&nbsp; We have got off
the oolites on to what is called the Oxford clay; and then, I believe,
on to the Coral rag, and on that again lies what we are coming to now.&nbsp;
Do you see the red sand in that field?</p>
<p>Then that is the lowest layer of a fresh world, so to speak; a world
still younger than the oolites&mdash;the chalk world.</p>
<p>But that is not chalk, or anything like it.</p>
<p>No, that is what is called Greensand.</p>
<p>But it is not green, it is red.</p>
<p>I know: but years ago it got the name from one green vein in it,
in which the &ldquo;Coprolites,&rdquo; as you learnt to call them at
Cambridge, are found; and that, and a little layer of blue clay, called
gault, between the upper Greensand and lower Greensand, runs along everywhere
at the foot of the chalk hills.</p>
<p>I see the hills now.&nbsp; Are they chalk?</p>
<p>Yes, chalk they are: so we may begin to feel near home now.&nbsp;
See how they range away to the south toward Devizes, and Westbury, and
Warminster, a goodly land and large.&nbsp; At their feet, everywhere,
run the rich pastures on which the Wiltshire cheese is made; and here
and there, as at Westbury, there is good iron-ore in the greensand,
which is being smelted now, as it used to be in the Weald of Surrey
and Kent ages since.&nbsp; I must tell you about that some other time.</p>
<p>But are there Coprolites here?</p>
<p>I believe there are: I know there are some at Swindon; and I do not
see why they should not be found, here and there, all the way along
the foot of the downs, from here to Cambridge.</p>
<p>But do these downs go to Cambridge?</p>
<p>Of course they do.&nbsp; We are now in the great valley which runs
right across England from south-west to north-east, from Axminster in
Devonshire to Hunstanton in Norfolk, with the chalk always on your right
hand, and the oolite hills on your left, till it ends by sinking into
the sea, among the fens of Lincolnshire and Norfolk.</p>
<p>But what made that great valley?</p>
<p>I am not learned enough to tell.&nbsp; Only this I think we can say&mdash;that
once on a time these chalk downs on our right reached high over our
heads here, and far to the north; and that Madam How pared them away,
whether by icebergs, or by sea-waves, or merely by rain, I cannot tell.</p>
<p>Well, those downs do look very like sea-cliffs.</p>
<p>So they do, very like an old shore-line.&nbsp; Be that as it may,
after the chalk was eaten away, Madam How began digging into the soils
below the chalk, on which we are now; and because they were mostly soft
clays, she cut them out very easily, till she came down, or nearly down,
to the harder freestone rocks which run along on our left hand, miles
away; and so she scooped out this great vale, which we call here the
Vale of White Horse; and further on, the Vale of Aylesbury; and then
the Bedford Level; and then the dear ugly old Fens.</p>
<p>Is this the Vale of White Horse?&nbsp; Oh, I know about it; I have
read <i>The Scouring of the White Horse</i>.</p>
<p>Of course you have; and when you are older you will read a jollier
book still,&mdash;<i>Tom Brown&rsquo;s School Days</i>&mdash;and when
we have passed Swindon, we shall see some of the very places described
in it, close on our right.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>There is the White Horse Hill.</p>
<p>The White Horse Hill?&nbsp; But where is the horse?&nbsp; I can see
a bit of him: but he does not look like a horse from here, or indeed
from any other place; he is a very old horse indeed, and a thousand
years of wind and rain have spoilt his anatomy a good deal on the top
of that wild down.</p>
<p>And is that really where Alfred fought the Danes?</p>
<p>As certainly, boy, I believe, as that Waterloo is where the Duke
fought Napoleon.&nbsp; Yes: you may well stare at it with all your eyes,
the noble down.&nbsp; It is one of the most sacred spots on English
soil.</p>
<p>Ah, it is gone now.&nbsp; The train runs so fast.</p>
<p>So it does; too fast to let you look long at one thing: but in return,
it lets you see so many more things in a given time than the slow old
coaches and posters did.&mdash;Well? what is it?</p>
<p>I wanted to ask you a question, but you won&rsquo;t listen to me.</p>
<p>Won&rsquo;t I?&nbsp; I suppose I was dreaming with my eyes open.&nbsp;
You see, I have been so often along this line&mdash;and through this
country, too, long before the line was made&mdash;that I cannot pass
it without its seeming full of memories&mdash;perhaps of ghosts.</p>
<p>Of real ghosts?</p>
<p>As real ghosts, I suspect, as any one on earth ever saw; faces and
scenes which have printed themselves so deeply on one&rsquo;s brain,
that when one passes the same place, long years after, they start up
again, out of fields and roadsides, as if they were alive once more,
and need sound sense to send them back again into their place as things
which are past for ever, for good and ill.&nbsp; But what did you want
to know?</p>
<p>Why, I am so tired of looking out of the window.&nbsp; It is all
the same: fields and hedges, hedges and fields; and I want to talk.</p>
<p>Fields and hedges, hedges and fields?&nbsp; Peace and plenty, plenty
and peace.&nbsp; However, it may seem dull, now that the grass is cut;
but you would not have said so two months ago, when the fields were
all golden-green with buttercups, and the whitethorn hedges like crested
waves of snow.&nbsp; I should like to take a foreigner down the Vale
of Berkshire in the end of May, and ask him what he thought of old England.&nbsp;
But what shall we talk about?</p>
<p>I want to know about Coprolites, if they dig them here, as they do
at Cambridge.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they do.&nbsp; But I suspect they will some day.</p>
<p>But why do people dig them?</p>
<p>Because they are rational men, and want manure for their fields.</p>
<p>But what are Coprolites?</p>
<p>Well, they were called Coprolites at first because some folk fancied
they were the leavings of fossil animals, such as you may really find
in the lias at Lynn in Dorsetshire.&nbsp; But they are not that; and
all we can say is, that a long time ago, before the chalk began to be
made, there was a shallow sea in England, the shore of which was so
covered with dead animals, that the bone-earth (the phosphate of lime)
out of them crusted itself round every bone, and shell, and dead sea-beast
on the shore, and got covered up with fresh sand, and buried for ages
as a mine of wealth.</p>
<p>But how many millions of dead creatures, there must have been!&nbsp;
What killed them?</p>
<p>We do not know.&nbsp; No more do we know how it comes to pass that
this thin band (often only a few inches thick) of dead creatures should
stretch all the way from Dorsetshire to Norfolk, and, I believe, up
through Lincolnshire.&nbsp; And what is stranger still, this same bone-earth
bed crops out on the south side of the chalk at Farnham, and stretches
along the foot of those downs, right into Kent, making the richest hop
lands in England, through Surrey, and away to Tunbridge.&nbsp; So that
it seems as if the bed lay under the chalk everywhere, if once we could
get down to it.</p>
<p>But how does it make the hop lands so rich?</p>
<p>Because hops, like tobacco and vines, take more phosphorus out of
the soil than any other plants which we grow in England; and it is the
washings of this bone-earth bed which make the lower lands in Farnham
so unusually rich, that in some of them&mdash;the garden, for instance,
under the Bishop&rsquo;s castle&mdash;have grown hops without resting,
I believe, for three hundred years.</p>
<p>But who found out all this about the Coprolites?</p>
<p>Ah&mdash;I will tell you; and show you how scientific men, whom ignorant
people sometimes laugh at as dreamers, and mere pickers up of useless
weeds and old stones, may do real service to their country and their
countrymen, as I hope you will some day.</p>
<p>There was a clergyman named Henslow, now with God, honoured by all
scientific men, a kind friend and teacher of mine, loved by every little
child in his parish.&nbsp; His calling was botany: but he knew something
of geology.&nbsp; And some of these Coprolites were brought him as curiosities,
because they had fossils in them.&nbsp; But he (so the tale goes) had
the wit to see that they were not, like other fossils, carbonate of
lime, but phosphate of lime&mdash;bone earth.&nbsp; Whereon he told
the neighbouring farmers that they had a mine of wealth opened to them,
if they would but use them for manure.&nbsp; And after a while he was
listened to.&nbsp; Then others began to find them in the Eastern counties;
and then another man, as learned and wise as he was good and noble&mdash;John
Paine of Farnham, also now with God&mdash;found them on his own estate,
and made much use and much money of them: and now tens of thousands
of pounds&rsquo; worth of valuable manure are made out of them every
year, in Cambridgeshire and Bedfordshire, by digging them out of land
which was till lately only used for common farmers&rsquo; crops.</p>
<p>But how do they turn Coprolites into manure?&nbsp; I used to see
them in the railway trucks at Cambridge, and they were all like what
I have at home&mdash;hard pebbles.</p>
<p>They grind them first in a mill.&nbsp; Then they mix them with sulphuric
acid and water, and that melts them down, and parts them into two things.&nbsp;
One is sulphate of lime (gypsum, as it is commonly called), and which
will not dissolve in water, and is of little use.&nbsp; But the other
is what is called superphosphate of lime, which will dissolve in water;
so that the roots of the plants can suck it up: and that is one of the
richest of manures.</p>
<p>Oh, I know: you put superphosphate on the grass last year.</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; But not that kind; a better one still.&nbsp; The superphosphate
from the Copiolites is good; but the superphosphate from fresh bones
is better still, and therefore dearer, because it has in it the fibrine
of the bones, which is full of nitrogen, like gristle or meat; and all
that has been washed out of the bone-earth bed ages and ages ago.&nbsp;
But you must learn some chemistry to understand that.</p>
<p>I should like to be a scientific man, if one can find out such really
useful things by science.</p>
<p>Child, there is no saying what you might find out, or of what use
you may be to your fellow-men.&nbsp; A man working at science, however
dull and dirty his work may seem at times, is like one of those &ldquo;chiffoniers,&rdquo;
as they call them in Paris&mdash;people who spend their lives in gathering
rags and sifting refuse, but who may put their hands at any moment upon
some precious jewel.&nbsp; And not only may you be able to help your
neighbours to find out what will give them health and wealth: but you
may, if you can only get them to listen to you, save them from many
a foolish experiment, which ends in losing money just for want of science.&nbsp;
I have heard of a man who, for want of science, was going to throw away
great sums (I believe he, luckily for him, never could raise the money)
in boring for coal in our Bagshot sands at home.&nbsp; The man thought
that because there was coal under the heather moors in the North, there
must needs be coal here likewise, when a geologist could have told him
the contrary.&nbsp; There was another man at Hennequin&rsquo;s Lodge,
near the Wellington College, who thought he would make the poor sands
fertile by manuring them with whale oil, of all things in the world.&nbsp;
So he not only lost all the cost of his whale oil, but made the land
utterly barren, as it is unto this day; and all for want of science.</p>
<p>And I knew a manufacturer, too, who went to bore an Artesian well
for water, and hired a regular well-borer to do it.&nbsp; But, meanwhile
he was wise enough to ask a geologist of those parts how far he thought
it was down to the water.&nbsp; The geologist made his calculations,
and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will go through so many feet of Bagshot sand; and so many
feet of London clay; and so many feet of the Thanet beds between them
and the chalk: and then you will win water, at about 412 feet; but not,
I think, till then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The well-sinker laughed at that, and said, &ldquo;He had no opinion
of geologists, and such-like.&nbsp; He never found any clay in England
but what he could get through in 150 feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he began to bore&mdash;150 feet, 200, 300: and then he began to
look rather silly; at last, at 405&mdash;only seven feet short of what
the geologist had foretold&mdash;up came the water in a regular spout.&nbsp;
But, lo and behold, not expecting to have to bore so deep, he had made
his bore much too small; and the sand out of the Thanet beds &ldquo;blew
up&rdquo; into the bore, and closed it.&nbsp; The poor manufacturer
spent hundreds of pounds more in trying to get the sand out, but in
vain; and he had at last to make a fresh and much larger well by the
side of the old one, bewailing the day when he listened to the well-sinker
and not to the geologist, and so threw away more than a thousand pounds.&nbsp;
And there is an answer to what you asked on board the yacht&mdash;What
use was there in learning little matters of natural history and science,
which seemed of no use at all?&nbsp; And now, look out again.&nbsp;
Do you see any change in the country?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Why, there to the left.</p>
<p>There are high hills there now, as well as to the right.&nbsp; What
are they?</p>
<p>Chalk hills too.&nbsp; The chalk is on both sides of us now.&nbsp;
These are the Chilterns, all away to Ipsden and Nettlebed, and so on
across Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire, and into Hertfordshire; and
on again to Royston and Cambridge, while below them lies the Vale of
Aylesbury; you can just see the beginning of it on their left.&nbsp;
A pleasant land are those hills, and wealthy; full of noble houses buried
in the deep beech-woods, which once were a great forest, stretching
in a ring round the north of London, full of deer and boar, and of wild
bulls too, even as late as the twelfth century, according to the old
legend of Thomas &agrave; Becket&rsquo;s father and the fair Saracen,
which you have often heard.</p>
<p>I know.&nbsp; But how are you going to get through the chalk hills?&nbsp;
Is there a tunnel as there is at Box and at Micheldever?</p>
<p>No.&nbsp; Something much prettier than a tunnel and something which
took a great many years longer in making.&nbsp; We shall soon meet with
a very remarkable and famous old gentleman, who is a great adept at
digging, and at landscape gardening likewise; and he has dug out a path
for himself through the chalk, which we shall take the liberty of using
also.&nbsp; And his name, if you wish to know it, is Father Thames.</p>
<p>I see him.&nbsp; What a great river!</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; Here he comes, gleaming and winding down from Oxford,
over the lowlands, past Wallingford; but where he is going to it is
not so easy to see.</p>
<p>Ah, here is chalk in the cutting at last.&nbsp; And what a high bridge.&nbsp;
And the river far under our feet.&nbsp; Why we are crossing him again!</p>
<p>Yes; he winds more sharply than a railroad can.&nbsp; But is not
this prettier than a tunnel?</p>
<p>Oh, what hanging-woods, and churches; and such great houses, and
pretty cottages and gardens&mdash;all in this narrow crack of a valley!</p>
<p>Ay.&nbsp; Old Father Thames is a good landscape gardener, as I said.&nbsp;
There is Basildon&mdash;and Hurley&mdash;and Pangbourne, with its roaring
lasher.&nbsp; Father Thames has had to work hard for many an age before
he could cut this trench right through the chalk, and drain the water
out of the flat vale behind us.&nbsp; But I suspect the sea helped him
somewhat, or perhaps a great deal, just where we are now.</p>
<p>The sea?</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; The sea was once&mdash;and that not so very long ago&mdash;right
up here, beyond Reading.&nbsp; This is the uppermost end of the great
Thames valley, which must have been an estuary&mdash;a tide flat, like
the mouth of the Severn, with the sea eating along at the foot of all
the hills.&nbsp; And if the land sunk only some fifty feet,&mdash;which
is a very little indeed, child, in this huge, ever-changing world,&mdash;then
the tide would come up to Reading again, and the greater part of London
and the county of Middlesex be drowned in salt water.</p>
<p>How dreadful that would be!</p>
<p>Dreadful indeed.&nbsp; God grant that it may never happen.&nbsp;
More terrible changes of land and water have happened, and are happening
still in the world: but none, I think, could happen which would destroy
so much civilisation and be such a loss to mankind, as that the Thames
valley should become again what it was, geologically speaking, only
the other day, when these gravel banks, over which we are running to
Reading, were being washed out of the chalk cliffs up above at every
tide, and rolled on a beach, as you have seen them rolling still at
Ramsgate.</p>
<p>Now here we are at Reading.&nbsp; There is the carriage waiting,
and away we are off home; and when we get home, and have seen everybody
and everything, we will look over our section once more.</p>
<p>But remember, that when you ran through the chalk hills to Reading,
you passed from the bottom of the chalk to the top of it, on to the
Thames gravels, which lie there on the chalk, and on to the London clay,
which lies on the chalk also, with the Thames gravels always over it.&nbsp;
So that, you see, the newest layers, the London clay and the gravels,
are lower in height than the limestone cliffs at Bristol, and much lower
than the old mountain ranges of Devonshire and Wales, though in geological
order they are far higher; and there are whole worlds of strata, rocks
and clays, one on the other, between the Thames gravels and the Devonshire
hills.</p>
<p>But how about our moors?&nbsp; They are newer still, you said, than
the London clay, because they lie upon it: and yet they are much higher
than we are here at Reading.</p>
<p>Very well said: so they are, two or three hundred feet higher.&nbsp;
But our part of them was left behind, standing up in banks, while the
valley of the Thames was being cut out by the sea.&nbsp; Once they spread
all over where we stand now, and away behind us beyond Newbury in Berkshire,
and away in front of us, all over where London now stands.</p>
<p>How can you tell that?</p>
<p>Because there are little caps&mdash;little patches&mdash;of them
left on the tops of many hills to the north of London; just remnants
which the sea, and the Thames, and the rain have not eaten down.&nbsp;
Probably they once stretched right out to sea, sloping slowly under
the waves, where the mouth of the Thames is now.&nbsp; You know the
sand-cliffs at Bournemouth?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Then those are of the same age as the Bagshot sands, and lie on the
London clay, and slope down off the New Forest into the sea, which eats
them up, as you know, year by year and day by day.&nbsp; And here were
once perhaps cliffs just like them, where London Bridge now stands.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>There, we are rumbling away home at last, over the dear old heather-moors.&nbsp;
How far we have travelled&mdash;in our fancy at least&mdash;since we
began to talk about all these things, upon the foggy November day, and
first saw Madam How digging at the sand-banks with her water-spade.&nbsp;
How many countries we have talked of; and what wonderful questions we
have got answered, which all grew out of the first question, How were
the heather-moors made?&nbsp; And yet we have not talked about a hundredth
part of the things about which these very heather-moors ought to set
us thinking.&nbsp; But so it is, child.&nbsp; Those who wish honestly
to learn the laws of Madam How, which we call Nature, by looking honestly
at what she does, which we call Fact, have only to begin by looking
at the very smallest thing, pin&rsquo;s head or pebble, at their feet,
and it may lead them&mdash;whither, they cannot tell.&nbsp; To answer
any one question, you find you must answer another; and to answer that
you must answer a third, and then a fourth; and so on for ever and ever.</p>
<p>For ever and ever?</p>
<p>Of course.&nbsp; If we thought and searched over the Universe&mdash;ay,
I believe, only over this one little planet called earth&mdash;for millions
on millions of years, we should not get to the end of our searching.&nbsp;
The more we learnt, the more we should find there was left to learn.&nbsp;
All things, we should find, are constituted according to a Divine and
Wonderful Order, which links each thing to every other thing; so that
we cannot fully comprehend any one thing without comprehending all things:
and who can do that, save He who made all things?&nbsp; Therefore our
true wisdom is never to fancy that we do comprehend: never to make systems
and theories of the Universe (as they are called) as if we had stood
by and looked on when time and space began to be; but to remember that
those who say they understand, show, simply by so saying, that they
understand nothing at all; that those who say they see, are sure to
be blind; while those who confess that they are blind, are sure some
day to see.&nbsp; All we can do is, to keep up the childlike heart,
humble and teachable, though we grew as wise as Newton or as Humboldt;
and to follow, as good Socrates bids us, Reason whithersoever it leads
us, sure that it will never lead us wrong, unless we have darkened it
by hasty and conceited fancies of our own, and so have become like those
foolish men of old, of whom it was said that the very light within them
was darkness.&nbsp; But if we love and reverence and trust Fact and
Nature, which are the will, not merely of Madam How, or even of Lady
Why, but of Almighty God Himself, then we shall be really loving, and
reverencing, and trusting God; and we shall have our reward by discovering
continually fresh wonders and fresh benefits to man; and find it as
true of science, as it is of this life and of the life to come&mdash;that
eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor hath it entered into the heart
of man to conceive, what God has prepared for those who love Him.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
